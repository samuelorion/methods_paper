    "abstract": "Segmenting the nuclei of cells in microscopy images is often the first step in the quantitative analysis of imaging data for biological and biomedical applications. Many bioimage analysis tools can segment nuclei in images but need to be selected and configured for every experiment. The 2018 Data Science Bowl attracted 3,891 teams worldwide to make the first attempt to build a segmentation method that could be applied to any two-dimensional light microscopy image of stained nuclei across experiments, with no human interaction. Top participants in the challenge succeeded in this task, developing deep-learning-based models that identified cell nuclei across many image types and experimental conditions without the need to manually adjust segmentation parameters. This represents an important step toward configuration-free bioimage analysis software tools.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the structure of the mammalian brain at cellular resolution is a challenging task and one that requires capturing key anatomical features at the appropriate level of analysis. Although neuroscientific methods have managed to provide significant insights at the micro and macro level, in order to obtain a whole-brain analysis at a cellular resolution requires a meso-scopic approach. A number of methods can be currently used to detect and count cells, with, nevertheless, significant limitations when analyzing data of high complexity. To overcome some of these constraints, we introduce a fully automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based method for whole-brain image processing to tect urons in different brain egions during evelopment ( ). We demonstrate a high performance of our deep neural network in detecting neurons labeled with different genetic markers in a range of imaging planes and imaging modalities.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the function of the nervous system necessitates mapping the spatial distributions of its constituent cells defined by function, anatomy or gene expression. Recently, developments in tissue preparation and microscopy allow cellular populations to be imaged throughout the entire rodent brain. How-ever, mapping these neurons manually is prone to bias and is often impractically time consuming. Here we present an opensource algorithm for fully automated 3D detection of neuronal somata in mouse whole-brain microscopy images using standard desktop computer hardware. We demonstrate the applicability and power of our approach by mapping the brain-wide locations of large populations of cells labeled with cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins expressed via retrograde trans-synaptic viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes survival of damaged mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Using a specific antibody directed against human recombinant BDNF, we studied the expression of the protein at the cellular level in the post-mortem mesencephalon of control subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In control subjects, BDNF was expressed in all mesencephalic regions containing dopaminergic neurons, and in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) 65% of the melanized neurons expressed BDNF. In the PD SNpc, the total number of pigmented neurons containing BDNF was reduced to 9.6% of the corresponding control value. In contrast, the number of pigmented neurons non-immunoreactive for BDNF was reduced to 23.9% of the corresponding control value. This result appears to indicate that SNpc melanized neurons not expressing BDNF have a 2.5-fold greater probability of surviving than BDNF-positive melanized neurons. Furthermore, we found that in parkinsonian mesencephalon almost all dopaminergic neurons containing Lewy bodies were immunoreactive for BDNF. These findings demonstrate a reduced expression of BDNF in PD and suggest that BDNF protein expression does not protect melanized SNpc neurons from the degenerative process in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Underactivity of the external segment of the globus pallidus is thought to contribute to the generation of parkinsonian hypokinetic symptoms in association with striatal dopaminergic dysfunction and overactivity of the subthalamus. These symptoms can be corrected by neurosurgical techniques aimed at normalizing subthalamic overactivity. The aim of the present study was to compare the amount of neurodegeneration and changes in the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin in the external segment of the globus pallidus in parkinsonian disorders. Cases with progressive supranuclear palsy were compared with cases with Parkinson's disease and control subjects. The number of neurones and neurofibrillary tangles was estimated using unbiased stereologic techniques. The external segment of the globus pallidus in Parkinson's disease was not significantly different from that in control subjects. In contrast, most patients with progressive supranuclear palsy had significant neurodegeneration of the external pallidum, particularly patients with significant degeneration of both the subthalamus and substantia nigra. These results suggest that the parkinsonian symptoms in progressive supranuclear palsy are caused by the degeneration of the external segment of the globus pallidus because such degeneration would increase thalamic inhibition through the basal ganglia output nuclei, particularly in patients with a loss of excitatory drive from the subthalamus.",

This is despite significant evidence that this basal ganglia region is crucially important for generating parkinsonian symptoms. In fact current surgical interventions target this region in Parkinson's disease. The cellular anatomy of the internal globus pallidus was compared among five controls, six patients with Parkinson's disease, and five patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. Neurons and pathological structures were quantified using the unbiased fractionator method. Only cases with progressive supranuclear palsy had detectable pathology within the internal globus pallidus in the form of tau-positive neuronal and glial tangles and substantial neurodegeneration. Cases with Parkinson's disease had a significant reduction in the proportion of neurons containing parvalbumin but were without significant neurodegeneration, consistent with dysfunction of both basal ganglia output nuclei in advanced parkinsonism. Surgical ablation of the internal globus pallidus for Parkinson's disease appears at odds with the significant neurodegeneration in the similarly akinetic and rigid patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. The results are discussed in association with current hypotheses of basal ganglia function and recent experimentation in patients undergoing pallidotomy for hyperkinetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "In diseases such as the Parkinson dementia complex of Guam (PDC) or Alzheimer's disease, susceptible neurons develop intracellular tangles (iNFTs) and then die, leaving behind extracellular tangles (eNFTs). We performed counts of healthy neurons, iNFTs, and eNFTs in the hippocampus of Guamanian Chamorros who were neurologically normal or who suffered from PDC. The total of surviving and dead neurons in the CA4 region was remarkably constant from case to case, indicating that eNFTs are not phagocytosed. Since cases of recent PDC showed only marginal tangle formation in CA4, we concluded that tangle development in CA4 commenced close to the onset of the disease. Based on this assumption, as well as the further assumption that the average rate of tangle development and the average lifetime of a tangled neuron do not alter as the disease progresses, we derived equations to determine the average lifetime of tangled neurons. The results varied from 0.13 years for the most rapidly progressing case to 7.98 years for the most slowly developing case. The average for 8 cases was 2.51 years.",

    "abstract": "Caspase-3 is an effector of apoptosis in experimental models of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, its potential role in the human pathology remains to be demonstrated. Using caspase-3 immunohistochemistry on the postmortem human brain, we observed a positive correlation between the degree of neuronal loss in dopaminergic (DA) cell groups affected in the mesencephalon of PD patients and the percentage of caspase-3-positive neurons in these cell groups in control subjects and a significant decrease of caspase-3-positive pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients compared with controls that also could be observed in an animal model of PD. This suggests that neurons expressing caspase-3 are more sensitive to the pathological process than those that do not express the protein. In addition, using an antibody raised against activated caspase-3, the percentage of active caspase-3-positive neurons among DA neurons was significantly higher in PD patients than in controls. Finally, electron microscopy analysis in the human brain and in vitro data suggest that caspase-3 activation precedes and is not a consequence of apoptotic cell death in PD.",

    "abstract": "Two major noncortical inputs to the striatum originate from the substantia nigra and the thalamic centré median-parafascicular complex. Although it is established that in Parkinson's disease there is degeneration of the nigral dopaminergic neurons, there has been little analysis of the glutamatergic centré median-parafascicular complex. We therefore evaluated these and neighboring thalamic nuclei (for specificity of any changes) in 9 Parkinson's disease patients and 8 age-matched controls. Degeneration in the substantia nigra and centré median-parafascicular complex was estimated by using quantitative neuronal counts. On average, 70% of the pigmented nigral neurons degenerated and there was 30% to 40% neuronal loss in the centré median-parafascicular complex in Parkinson's disease. Thalamic degeneration was marked in neuronal subpopulations (50% loss of parvalbumin-positive neurons in the parafascicular, and 70% loss of non-parvalbumin-positive neurons in the centré median nuclei). In contrast, adjacent thalamic nuclei did not degenerate, which supports a selective neurodegeneration of the centré median-parafascicular complex. Our results show that the thalamic centré median-parafascicular complex is an additional nondopaminergic site of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Because this thalamic region provides important sensorimotor feedback to the striatum, degeneration of this region is likely to exacerbate the clinical signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway. However, not all dopaminergic neurons degenerate in this disease, and calcium has been suspected of playing a role in this differential vulnerability. An overexpression of the calcium-dependent protease calpain II has recently been reported in the parkinsonian substantia nigra, suggesting that a rise in intracellular calcium concentrations may be involved in the mechanism leading to cell death. The proteasic activity of calpain is regulated by an endogenous inhibitory protein called calpastatin. Because little is known about the distribution of calpastatin in the primate brain, we first analyzed immunohistochemically the calpastatin expression in normal human and monkey brain. A ubiquitous distribution of calpastatin immunostaining was observed in both cases, but its expression was variable from one region to another. In the basal ganglia, staining was intense in the striatum, in the pallidal complex, and in some nuclei of the thalamus. The cerebellum was stained intensely, particularly in the granular and Purkinje cell layers. A dense, heterogeneous staining was observed in the hippocampal formation, mostly in the pyramidal and granular layers. The distribution of staining was similar in the different cerebral cortices studied, and it was most intense in layer V. In the brainstem, staining was particularly prominent in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and compacta, the central gray substance, the superior colliculus, and the cuneiform nucleus, and staining was moderate in the tegmenti pedonculopontinus nucleus and the griseum pontis. In the second part of the study, the authors compared calpastatin expression in the mesencephalon between patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects. Sequential double staining revealed that some dopaminergic neurons coexpress calpastatin, the proportion of double-stained neurons ranging between 52% and 76% among the different dopaminergic cell groups. Quantitative analysis of the number of calpastatin-stained neurons evidenced a loss of both calpastatin-positive and calpastatin-negative neurons in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease. These data suggest that calpain II overexpression in Parkinson's disease is not compensated for by a concomitant increase in calpastatin expression.",

    "abstract": "Whilst many reports mention neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the thalamus in progressive supranuclear palsy, there has been little detailed regional analysis of the distribution and density of thalamic pathology in this disease or in other parkinsonian syndromes. The caudal intralaminar thalamic nuclei are the major thalamic regulators of the caudate nucleus and putamen, areas known to be dysfunctional in progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease. We investigated whether these thalamic nuclei degenerate in patients with these disorders compared with age-matched, neurologically normal controls. Neurofibrillary tangle and Lewy body pathology was assessed and unbiased optical disector methods were used to quantify total neuronal number. Despite different thalamic pathology, there was a dramatic reduction in the total neuronal number in the caudal intralaminar nuclei in both progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease (40-55% loss). In contrast, there was no loss of volume or total neuronal number in the limbic thalamic nuclei in either disease group, indicating selective degeneration of the caudal intralaminar nuclei. In Parkinson's disease, Lewy bodies were found in these regions, while in progressive supranuclear palsy abundant intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and glial tangles concentrated in the caudal intralaminar nuclei. However, tangle formation accounted for only a small proportion of cell loss (</=10%) in the thalamus in progressive supranuclear palsy. These findings have several implications. The caudal intralaminar thalamus appears to be one of three basal ganglia sites commonly affected in both progressive supranuclear palsy and Parkinson's disease. These sites are the dopaminergic substantia nigra, the cholinergic pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and, from our results, the glutamatergic caudal intralaminar thalamus. In both diseases these sites contain characteristic but different pathologies, indicating disease-specific mechanisms of neurodegeneration. Interestingly, the proportion of remaining neurons affected by these pathologies is low. This may indicate additional (possibly common) cellular mechanisms responsible for the degeneration in these regions. Both the dopaminergic nigra and the glutamatergic caudal intralaminar thalamus are the major regulators of basal ganglia function via the caudate nucleus and putamen. The pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus has major projections to both of these regulators. These findings indicate that dysregulation of two neurotransmitter systems within the basal ganglia may underlie common parkinsonian symptoms in these disorders. For patients with Parkinson's disease, this loss of glutamate regulation may help explain some problems with dopamine replacement therapies, particularly over time. For patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, more widespread degeneration of basal ganglia structures would contribute to poor treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has potent effects on survival and morphology of dopaminergic neurons and thus its loss could contribute to death of these cells in Parkinson's disease (PD). In situ hybridization revealed that BDNF mRNA is strongly expressed by dopaminergic neurons in control substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). In clinically and neuropathologically typical PD, SNpc BDNF mRNA expression is reduced by 70% (P = 0.001). This reduction is due, in part, to loss of dopaminergic neurons which express BDNF. However, surviving dopaminergic neurons in the PD SNpc also expressed less BDNF mRNA (20%, P = 0.02) than their normal counterparts. Moreover, while 15% of control neurons had BDNF mRNA expression >1 SD below the control mean, twice as many (28%) of the surviving PD SNpc dopaminergic neurons had BDNF mRNA expression below this value. This 13% difference in proportions (95% CI 8-17%, P < or = 0.000001) indicates the presence of a subset of neurons in PD with particularly low BDNF mRNA expression. Moreover, both control and PD neurons displayed a direct relationship between the density of BDNF mRNA expression per square micrometer of cell surface and neuronal size (r(2) = 0.93, P </= 0.00001) which was lost only in PD neurons expressing the lowest levels of BDNF mRNA. If BDNF is an autocrine/paracrine factor for SNpc dopaminergic neurons, loss of BDNF-expressing neurons may compromise the well-being of their surviving neighbors. Moreover, neurons expressing particularly low levels of BDNF mRNA may be those at greatest risk of injury in PD and possibly the trigger for the degeneration itself.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are closely related to disturbed cholinergic transmission. The decrease of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor protein has been assessed by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Stereology, however, has not been used to assess numbers of receptor-expressing human cerebrocortical neurons. Our approach applies a combination of alpha7 subunit-immunohistochemistry with a stereological technique using defined stretches of pial surface as reference standard. The number of alpha7 subunit protein-expressing neurons in the Alzheimer temporal cortices amounted to approximately half of that of controls while numbers in Parkinson patients lay in between. No differences in the total number of neurons were seen. These results corroborate nonstereological studies on Alzheimer cortices and for the first time show a similar decrease in receptor expression in Parkinson's disease. They provide evidence that not only Alzheimer dementia but also cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease may be related to decreased nicotinic receptor expression.",

    "abstract": "The consistent regional and laminar distribution of cortical Lewy bodies (LB) in brains of patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) suggests that only a certain subpopulation of neurons develops these alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions. This study examined whether four non-overlapping neuronal subpopulations, defined by the expression of non-phosphorylated neurofilaments (SMI-32) and several calcium binding proteins (parvalbumin, calretinin and calbindin D28k), are vulnerable to LB formation. We performed peroxidase immunostaining to examine the distribution and to quantitate each neuronal subpopulation within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) area, and double-label immunohistochemistry to test for colocalization of alpha-synuclein and each neuronal marker in the STS and the entorhinal cortex. There were no significant differences between DLB brains and controls in the proportional quantity or laminar distribution of each neuronal subpopulation. Parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons represented around 7%, calbindin D28k 8%, calretinin 10%, and SMI-32 about 20% of the total neuronal population in the STS cortex. Neurons expressing parvalbumin and SMI-32 showed a widespread distribution across layers II to VI. Neurons expressing calretinin were present in superficial layers (II to IV), and calbindin D28k-immunoreactive neurons were mostly distributed within granular layers II and IV. None of the LB observed in the STS or the entorhinal cortex were located in neurons expressing calcium binding proteins; 25% of the LB were contained in SMI-32 immunoreactive neurons. In conclusion, cortical neurons expressing calcium binding proteins are spared in DLB, while SMI-32-positive neurons are affected in proportion to their density in the cortex. However, the majority of cortical LB develop in neurons not identified by any of these markers.",

    "abstract": "Clinical studies suggest involvement of brain noradrenergic systems in the pathophysiology of disruptive agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This behavioral problem is even more prevalent in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Here we used receptor autoradiography with [(125)I]para-iodoclonidine to estimate alpha-2 adrenergic receptor (A2R) density in locus coeruleus (LC) projection areas in postmortem brain tissue from age and gender comparable groups of DLB (n = 6), AD (n = 5) and normal (n = 7) subjects. LC neuronal loss was substantial and equivalent in DLB and AD. A2R density was greater in DLB than in normals in the deep layers of the frontal cortex. A2R density was greater in DLB than in AD in hippocampus (CA-1, CA-3 and dentate hilus) and in the granule layer of the cerebellum. Increased A2R binding in DLB is consistent with expression of presynaptic A2R on fibers from surviving LC neurons involved in reinnervation of LC projection areas. These areas develop compensatory noradrenergic hyperinnervation in a rat model of partial LC ablation. It is also consistent with upregulation of post-synaptic A2R in response to loss of LC noradrenergic innervation. Either mechanism could lower the threshold for increased agitation in response to noradrenergic outflow in these dementing disorders.",

    "abstract": "The human arcuate nucleus (ArcN) has been considered akin to the pontine precerebellar nuclei. However, there is anatomical, functional, and clinical evidence that the ArcN may be the homologue of chemosensitive areas of the ventral medullary surface involved in ventilatory responses to hypercarbia and cerebrospinal fluid acidosis. Acetylcholine has been involved in mechanisms of central chemosensitivity. Loss of ArcN neurons has been reported in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), a disorder characterized by disturbed automatic ventilation, but the neurochemical identity of these neurons is undetermined. We sought to determine whether the ArcN contains cholinergic neurons and whether these neurons are depleted in patients with MSA. Medullae were obtained from six patients with MSA, five patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and six sex- and age-matched controls. Fifty-micron transverse sections obtained through the mid-olivary levels were processed for acetylcholinesterase (AchE), choline acetyltransferase (CAT), and alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. We found that the ArcN contained CAT-positive neurons. There was a significant decrease in density of cholinergic ArcN neurons in MSA but not in PD patients. alpha-Synuclein-containing inclusions were present in the ArcN of MSA patients. Depletion of cholinergic neurons may provide a substrate for disturbances in automatic respiration in MSA patients.",

    "abstract": "Ceruloplasmin (CP) is a 132 kd cuproprotein which, together with transferrin, provides the majority of anti-oxidant capacity in serum. Increased iron deposition and lipid peroxidation in the basal ganglia of subjects with hereditary CP deficiency suggest that CP may serve as an anti-oxidant in the brain as well. The present study compared CP immunoreactivity in brain specimens from normal controls and subjects with neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease [AD], Parkinson's disease [PD], progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], and Huntington's disease [HD]) (n = 5 per group). The relative intensity of neuronal CP staining and the numbers of CP-stained neurons per 25x microscope field were determined in hippocampus (CA1, subiculum, and parahippocampal gyrus), parietal cortex, frontal cortex, substantia nigra, and caudate. CP was detected in both neurons and astrocytes in all specimens, and in senile plaques and occasional neurofibrillary tangles in AD brain. Neuronal CP staining intensity tended to increase in most AD brain regions, but was statistically significant vs controls only in the CA1 region of hippocampus (p = .016). Neuronal CP staining in brain specimens from other neurodegenerative disorders showed a slight but nonsignificant increase vs controls. The numbers of CP-stained neurons per field did not differ between the various neurodegenerative disorders and controls. These results suggest that a modest increase in neuronal CP content is present in the AD brain, and lesser elevations in neuronal CP occur in the other neurodegenerative disorders in this study. Though CP functions as both an acute phase protein and an anti-oxidant in peripheral tissues, whether it does so in the brain remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Two types of ubiquitinated inclusions have been described in motor neurone disease (MND). (1) Skein or globular ubiquitinated inclusions in the motor neurones (more frequently in the lower motor neurones). This is a characteristic feature of all motor neurone disease categories. (2) Dot-shape or crescentric ubiquitinated inclusions in the upper layers of cortex and dentate gyrus described in cases of motor neurone disease with dementia (DMND). We investigated the substantia nigra (SN) in MND cases; two cases of motor neurone disease inclusion body (MND-IB) dementia, six cases of DMND, 14 cases of MND (including one case from Guam and two cases of familial SOD1 mutation), four cases of Parkinson's disease (PD), and 10 cases of age-matched normal controls. SN and spinal cord sections were stained with ubiquitin (alpha-synuclein, tau, PGM1, SMI-31 and SOD1 antibodies). The neuronal density in SN was quantified by using a computer-based image analysis system. Four out of six DMND cases showed rounded ubiquitin positive inclusions with irregular frayed edges, associated with neuronal loss, reactive astrocytosis and a large number of activated microglia cells. These inclusions are negative with antibodies to (alpha-synuclein, tau, SMI-31 and SOD1). The SN in cases from MND-IB dementia and MND showed occasional neuronal loss and no inclusions. The ubiquitin-only inclusions in SN of DMND cases are similar (but not identical) to the ubiquitinated inclusions described previously in the spinal cord of MND cases and are distinct from Lewy bodies (LBs). The degeneration of SN is most likely a primary neurodegenerative process of motor neurone disease type frequently involving the DMND cases. MND disease is a spectrum and multisystem disorder with DMND located at the extreme end of a spectrum affecting the CNS more widely than just the motor system.",

    "abstract": "The amygdala exhibits significant pathological changes in Parkinson's disease, including atrophy and Lewy body (LB) formation. Amygdala pathology has been suggested to contribute to some clinical features of Parkinson's disease, including deficits of olfaction and facial expression. The degree of neuronal loss in amygdala subnuclei and the relationship with LB formation in non-demented Parkinson's disease cases have not been examined previously. Using stereological methods, the volume of neurones and the number of neurones in amygdala subdivisions were estimated in 18 prospectively studied, non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease and 16 age- and sex-matched controls. Careful exclusion (all cortical disease) and inclusion (non-demented, levodopa-responsive, idiopathic Parkinson's disease or controls) criteria were applied. Seven Parkinson's disease cases experienced well-formed visual hallucinations many years after disease onset, while nine Parkinson's disease cases and three controls were treated for depression. Anatomically, the amygdala was subdivided into the lateral nucleus, the basal (basolateral and basomedial) nuclei and the corticomedial (central, medial and cortical nuclei) complex. LB and Lewy neurites were identified by immunohistochemistry for alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin and were assessed semiquantitatively. LB were found throughout the amygdala in Parkinson's disease, being present in approximately 4% of neurones. Total amygdala volume was reduced by 20% in Parkinson's disease (P = 0.02) and LB concentrated in the cortical and basolateral nuclei. Lewy neurites were present in most cases but did not correlate with any structural or functional variable. Amygdala volume loss was largely due to a 30% reduction in volume (P = 0.01) and the total estimated number of neurones (P = 0.007) in the corticomedial complex. The degree of neurone loss and the proportion of LB-containing neurones in the cortical nucleus within this complex were constant across Parkinson's disease cases and neither variable was related to disease duration (R(2 )< 0.03; P > 0.5). The cortical nucleus has major olfactory connections and its degeneration is likely to contribute to the early selective anosmia common in Parkinson's disease. There was a small reduction in neuronal density in the basolateral nucleus in all Parkinson's disease cases, but no consistent volume or cell loss within this region. However, the proportion of LB-containing neurones in the basolateral nucleus was nearly doubled in cases that exhibited visual hallucinations, suggesting that neuronal dysfunction in this nucleus contributes to this late clinical feature. Detailed quantitation of the other amygdala subdivisions failed to reveal any other substantial anomalies or any associations with depression. Thus, the impact of Parkinson's disease on the amygdala is highly selective and correlates with both early and late clinical features.",

    "abstract": "Previous data suggest a relationship between the loss of response to levodopa in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with the co-occurrence of dementia, but the role of alterations in the dopamine system has not been explored. We measured the extent of striatal DA loss and changes in striatal DA D(2) and D(3) receptors in postmortem striatum of PD patients who historically had or had not lost their clinical response to dopaminergic drugs and/or had an additional diagnosis of dementia. Clinical evaluation and retrospective chart reviews for PD and dementia, and neuropathological diagnoses were obtained. All PD cases (+/-dementia), regardless of response to dopaminergic drugs, exhibited a significant and similar degree and pattern of loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunocytochemistry and DA transporter binding in striatum, and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons and brain-derived neurotrophic-immunoreactive neurons from the ventral midbrain. D(2) receptor concentrations were modestly elevated in the rostral striatum of all the PD cases (+/-dementia), whether or not they continued to respond to dopaminergic drugs. In contrast, loss of D(3) receptor concentration correlated with loss of response to dopaminergic drugs, independent of the presence or absence of dementia. A maintained response to dopaminergic drugs correlated with an elevation of D(3) receptors. Dementia with PD was highly correlated with a loss of response to dopaminergic drugs, and was also correlated with reduced D(3) receptors. The alterations in D(3) receptor concentrations were greatest in the nucleus accumbens, caudal striatum, and globus pallidus. Thus, loss of dopamine D(3) receptors may be a more important contributing factor to a loss of response to dopaminergic drugs than changes in the D(2) receptor.",

    "abstract": "The nonprimary motor cortices have not previously been studied in Parkinson's disease, despite the selective pattern of dysfunction observed in these regions. In particular, the pre-supplementary motor region is consistently underactive, with successful treatments correlating with increased excitatory drive to nonprimary motor regions. This finding could suggest a primary cortical abnormality in the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) in Parkinson's disease. We analysed and compared neuronal number in the pre-SMA and dorsolateral premotor cortical regions in 5 cases of Parkinson's disease and 5 controls. For each cortical region, the total neuronal number as well as the estimated numbers of subpopulations of interneurons and pyramidal neurons was quantified using previously published unbiased techniques. The results showed a significant loss of cortico-cortical projecting pyramidal neurons in the pre-SMA with no loss of other pyramidal neurons or interneurons either in this region or in the dorsolateral premotor region. These findings indicate a highly selective loss of pyramidal cells in the pre-SMA in Parkinson's disease, consistent with previous imaging findings in this disease. Our results implicate the degeneration of the premotor projection from the pre-SMA, along with dopaminergic basal ganglia dysfunction, in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "We sought to determine whether there are neurokinin-1 receptor-like-immunoreactive (NK-1R-LI) neurons in human ventrolateral medulla and whether these neurons are more severely involved in multiple system atrophy (MSA) than in Parkinson's disease. Brains were obtained at autopsy from six control subjects, six subjects with clinical diagnosis of MSA and four with Parkinson's disease, both confirmed neuropathologically. Serial 50 microm cryostat sections were obtained throughout the medulla, and every eighth section was processed for NK-1R-LI neurons. Some sections were processed simultaneously for tyrosine hydroxylase or choline acetyltransferase. Abundant NK-1R-LI neurons were identified in the ventrolateral medulla. These neurons were distinct from local cholinergic or catecholaminergic neurons. There was a severe depletion of these NK-1R-LI neurons in all MSA cases compared with controls (6 +/- 1 cells/section versus 49 +/- 2 cells/section in controls). Although there was also a reduction in Parkinson's disease (20 +/- 2 cells/section), this was significantly less severe than in MSA. Our findings suggest that the human ventrolateral medulla contains NK-1R-LI neurons, and the more severe depletion in MSA than in Parkinson's disease may explain the higher incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular abnormalities in the former condition.",

The AR-type showed higher neuronal losses in locus coeruleus (LC) and in medial and lateral parts of substantia nigra (SNM, SNL), suggesting lesion patterns different from the T-type. More severe cell loss in the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus was observed in PD patients with depression than in non-depressed ones. Demented PD subjects showed higher cell loss in SNM than non-demented ones indicating dysfunction of the mesocortical dopamine system, and significantly more severe Alzheimer lesions in isocortex and hippocampus. These and other recent data from the literature indicate that some major clinical features of PD are related to lesions of distinct neuronal systems.",

The PD patients had more than 55% fewer midbrain DA neurons than age-matched normal subjects. The cell loss occurred within the combined substantia nigra and retrorubral area (greater than 61%; DA nuclei A9 and A8, respectively), and the ventral tegmental area (greater than 42%; DA nucleus A10). The cell loss was greatest within the ventral portion of the nucleus A9. A similar pattern of DA cell loss was observed in MPTP-treated Macaca fascicularis monkeys. The CaBP-containing cells were located specifically in the cell regions spared by PD and by MPTP-treatment in both monkeys and C57BL/6 mice. These data suggest that PD and MPTP both destroy the same population of midbrain DA neurons within nuclei A8, A9, and A10, and that perhaps CaBP protects the DA neurons from cell death caused by both PD and MPTP.",

There was comparable cell loss in all three diseases (approximately 60%) compared with aged normal subjects, and there was a significant loss of nucleus subcoeruleus cells specifically in patients with Parkinson's disease (63%). There was a significant positive correlation between the magnitude of locus coeruleus cell loss and the duration of Alzheimer's disease, but no such correlation was found for Parkinson's disease. In patients with Parkinson's disease, there was comparable cell loss throughout the rostral-caudal extent of the nucleus; however, in patients with Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome, the greatest cell loss always occurred within the rostral portion of the nucleus, with a relative sparing of caudal cells. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that cell loss in Parkinson's disease is the result of a pathological process that attacks the catecholaminergic cells of the locus coeruleus and the subcoeruleus in general; in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome, however, the pathological process only affects the rostral, cortical-projecting locus coeruleus cells and spares the caudal, noncortical-projecting cells.",

    "abstract": "The contribution of neuromelanin (NM) to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) has long been suspected. In particular, a correlation has been reported between the estimated cell loss in the mesencephalic dopaminergic cell groups and the percentage of NM-pigmented neurons in these cell groups. To test whether the amount of pigment per cell is a critical factor or whether the presence of NM within a neuron is sufficient to account for the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, the NM content was measured in each neuron from representative sections throughout the ventral mesencephalon of four controls subjects and four patients with PD. Intraneuronal NM was quantified by a densitometric method, using known amounts of synthetic melanin as standards. In control brains, the distribution of melanized neurons in the nigral complex showed a high proportion of lightly melanized neurons in the ventral tegmental area and the pars alpha and gamma of the substantia nigra (SN), whereas heavily melanized neurons were mostly located in the pars beta and lateralis of the SN. An inverse relationship was observed between the percentage of surviving neurons in PD compared with controls and the amount of NM they contain, suggesting that the vulnerability of the dopaminergic neurons is related to their NM content. Factors other than NM may be involved in the differential vulnerability of catecholaminergic neurons in PD. In particular, the constant topography of the cell loss suggests that cell position within the nigral complex is a key factor.",

    "abstract": "Hyposmia is one of the most prevalent symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It may occur even before the motor symptoms start. To determine whether the olfactory dysfunctions, like the motor symptoms, are associated with a loss of dopamine, the number of dopaminergic cells in the olfactory bulb of Parkinson's disease patients was studied using tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. The quantitative analysis reveals that the total number of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the olfactory bulb is twice as high in Parkinson patients compared to age and gender-matched controls. Because dopamine is known to inhibit olfactory transmission in the olfactory glomeruli, we suggest that the increase of dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb is responsible for the hyposmia in Parkinson patients. The increase of dopamine in the olfactory bulb explains why olfaction does not improve with levodopa therapy.",

Quadrants areas within the SN were determined with a planimeter and neuronal density was expressed as neurons/mm(2) for 10 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases, 29 incidental Lewy body cases, and 178 controls with neither condition. Mean densities in all quadrants were significantly lower in the PD group compared with the other groups (p = 0.006). This relationship was strongest in the ventrolateral quadrant. In a subgroup of 50 controls who were examined with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale an average of 2.1 years prior to death, there was an association of stooped posture (p = 0.009), postural instability (p = 0.013), body bradykinesia (p = 0.048), and gait disturbance (p = 0.05) with neuron density in the dorsolateral quadrant; and impaired speech (p = 0.014), abnormal facial expression (p = 0.022), and difficulty rising from a chair (p = 0.032) with neuron density in the dorsomedial quadrant. There was a significant association of increasing number of signs present with decreasing neuron density in both quadrants (p = 0.001 for trend). Low SN neuron density may be the basis for parkinsonian signs in the elderly without PD.",

The total mean neocortical neuron number in the patients with PD was 18.6 x 10(9) with a coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean) of 0.18, which was not statistically significantly different from that of the controls (18.8 x 10(9); CV = 0.16; P = 0.90). In contrast to some studies reporting neocortical atrophy this was not confirmed in our study, where the mean volume of neocortex was the same in the two groups (P = 0.59). No difference was found in the volume of white matter, central gray structures, archicortex, or the ventricular system between the two groups. Most patients with PD develop cognitive disturbances with time, and this study cannot exclude that local neuron loss in specific subpopulations of neocortical neurons or cell loss in small but essential neocortical subregions may be part of the structural defects of PD.",

    "abstract": "We sought to determine the involvement of medullary regions controlling sympathetic output in pathologically confirmed diffuse Lewy body disease (LBD). We studied eight limbic or neocortical stage LBD and eight multiple system atrophy (MSA) cases, confirmed neuropathologically, and eight age-matched controls. Five of the LBD cases and all MSA cases had orthostatic hypotension. Serial 50-mum sections obtained from the medulla rostral to the obex were immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase, tryptophan hydroxylase and alpha-synuclein. Analysis was focused on the ventrolateral medulla and medullary raphe nuclei. In LBD cases, there were Lewy bodies and neurites, as well as dystrophic neurons in the ventrolateral medulla, but the number of catecholaminergic and serotonergic neurons was not significantly reduced. All these groups were depleted in MSA. There were Lewy body pathology and dystrophic neurons in the raphe in all LBD cases. Cell numbers were reduced in both the raphe obscurus and raphe pallidus. Our findings suggest that, although LBD affects medullary autonomic areas, it does so less severely than MSA, particularly in the case of the VLM, which controls sympathetic outputs maintaining arterial pressure. In LBD, orthostatic hypotension may be due primarily to involvement of sympathetic ganglion neurons rather than ventrolateral medulla neurons.",

    "abstract": "Dystonia is a neurological syndrome characterized by sustained muscle contractions that produce repetitive twisting movements or abnormal postures. X-linked recessive dystonia parkinsonism (XDP; DYT3; Lubag) is an adult-onset disorder that manifests severe and progressive dystonia with a high frequency of generalization. In search for the anatomical basis for dystonia, we performed postmortem analyses of the functional anatomy of the basal ganglia based on the striatal compartments (ie, the striosomes and the matrix compartment) in XDP. Here, we provide anatomopathological evidence that, in the XDP neostriatum, the matrix compartment is relatively spared in a unique fashion, whereas the striosomes are severely depleted. We also document that there is a differential loss of striatal neuron subclasses in XDP. In view of the three-pathway basal ganglia model, we postulate that the disproportionate involvement of neostriatal compartments and their efferent projections may underlie the manifestation of dystonia in patients with XDP. This study is the first to our knowledge to show specific basal ganglia pathology that could explain the genesis of dystonia in human heredodegenerative movement disorders, suggesting that dystonia may result from an imbalance in the activity between the striosomal and matrix-based pathways.",

    "abstract": "Changes in motor cortical activation are associated with the major symptoms observed in both Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). While research has concentrated on basal ganglia abnormalities as central to these cortical changes, several studies in both disorders have shown pathology in the thalamus and motor cortices. In particular, we recently reported an 88% loss of corticocortical projection neurones in the pre-supplementary motor (pre-SMA) cortex in Parkinson's disease. Further analysis of the degree of neuronal loss and pathology in motor cortices and their thalamocortical relays in Parkinson's disease and PSP is warranted. Six cases with PSP, nine cases with Parkinson's disease and nine controls were selected from a prospectively studied brain donor cohort. alpha-Synuclein, ubiquitin and tau immunohistochemistry were used to identify pathological lesions. Unbiased stereological methods were used to analyse atrophy and neuronal loss in the motor thalamus [ventral anterior, ventrolateral anterior and ventrolateral posterior (VLp) nuclei] and motor cortices (primary motor, dorsolateral premotor and pre-SMA cortices). Analysis of variance and post hoc testing was used to determine differences between groups. In Parkinson's disease, the motor thalamus and motor cortices (apart from the pre-SMA) were preserved containing only rare alpha-synuclein-positive and ubiquitin-positive Lewy bodies. In contrast, patients with PSP had significant atrophy and neuronal loss in VLp (22 and 30%, respectively), pre-SMA (21 and 51%, respectively) and primary motor cortices (33 and 54%, respectively). In the primary motor cortex of PSP cases, neuronal loss was confined to inhibitory interneurones, whereas in the pre-SMA both interneurones (reduced by 26%) and corticocortical projection neurones (reduced by 82%) were affected. Tau-positive neurofibrillary and glial tangles were observed throughout the motor thalamus and motor cortices in PSP. These non-dopaminergic lesions in motor circuits are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of both PSP and Parkinson's disease. The selective involvement of the VLp and primary motor cortex in PSP implicates these cerebellothalamocortical pathways as differentiating this disease, possibly contributing to the early falls.",

Nurr1 is involved in the establishment and maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype within specific central nervous system neuronal subpopulations including the nigrostriatal dopamine system.

The present study examined the role of Nurr1 in the maintenance of the dopaminergic phenotype within neurons in substantia nigra in PD compared with patients with diagnoses of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) or age-matched-matched controls. In PD, the optical density (OD) of Nurr1 immunofluorescence was significantly decreased in nigral neurons containing alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions. Similarly, the OD of Nurr1 immunofluorescence intensity in the nigra of AD cases was decreased in neurons with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). In contrast to PD and AD, the OD of Nurr1 immunofluorescence intensity was severely decreased in the neurons with or without NFTs in PSP cases. Decline of Nurr1-ir neuronal number and OD was observed within substantia nigra (SN) neurons in PD but not within hippocampal neurons. The decline in Nurr1-ir expression was correlated with loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunofluorescence across the four groups. These data demonstrate that Nurr1 deficiency in dopaminergic neurons is associated with the intracellular pathology in both synucleinopathies and tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "In Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a significant loss of locus ceruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons. However, functional and anatomical evidence indicates that the remaining noradrenergic neurons may be compensating for the loss. Because the noradrenergic system plays an important role in learning and memory, it is important to determine whether compensation occurs in noradrenergic neurons in the LC and hippocampus of subjects with AD or a related dementing disorder, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We observed profound neuronal loss in the LC in AD and DLB subjects with three major changes in the noradrenergic system consistent with compensation: (1) an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA expression in the remaining neurons; (2) sprouting of dendrites into peri-LC dendritic zone, as determined by alpha2-adrenoreceptors (ARs) and norepinephrine transporter binding sites; and (3) sprouting of axonal projections to the hippocampus as determined by alpha2-ARs. In AD and DLB subjects, the postsynaptic alpha1-ARs were normal to elevated. Expression of alpha1A- and alpha2A-AR mRNA in the hippocampus of AD and DLB subjects were not altered, but expression of alpha1D- and alpha2C-AR mRNA was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of AD and DLB subjects. Therefore, in AD and DLB subjects, there is compensation occurring in the remaining noradrenergic neurons, but there does appear to be a loss of specific AR in the hippocampus. Because changes in these noradrenergic markers in AD versus DLB subjects were similar (except neuronal loss and the increase in TH mRNA were somewhat greater in DLB subjects), the presence of Lewy bodies in addition to plaques and tangles in DLB subjects does not appear to further affect the noradrenergic compensatory changes.",

    "abstract": "The cholinergic basal forebrain is divided into four subregions (Ch1-4), and cholinergic neuronal loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (Ch4) has been correlated with cognitive impairments in both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). However, the Ch1-2 regions, which provide the major cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus, have not been investigated in DLB. The purpose of this study was to reveal the cholinergic neuronal changes in the medial septum (Ch1) and the nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band (Ch2) of DLB brains. Using choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry, we showed that the number of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons in DLB brains was significantly lower than the numbers in AD and non-demented (control) brains. No significant difference in the number of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons was found between the AD and control brains. Moreover, the size of the ChAT-immunoreactive neurons was significantly smaller in the AD and DLB brains than in the control brains. These results show that cholinergic neurons of the Ch1-2 regions are more severely affected in DLB than in AD. Our DLB cases did not fulfill the neuropathologic criteria for definite AD. Furthermore, some Lewy bodies were observed in the Ch1-2 regions. Thus, cholinergic neuronal loss in the Ch1-2 regions might be specific to the pathology of DLB. Taking the distribution of cholinergic fibers in the hippocampus into consideration, this study suggests a possibility that hippocampal cholinergic projection is involved in Lewy-related neurites in the CA2-3 regions, the origin of which remains unclear.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the most common movement disorder in the broad spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, associated frequently with gradual decline of the higher mental faculties. From the morphological point of view it is characterized by the degeneration of a substantial number of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and a considerable degeneration of neuronal networks in locus coeruleus, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus and some areas of the cortex of the brain hemispheres. Filamentous inclusions, in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neuritis, composed mainly of alpha synuclein, been the hallmark of diffuse Lewy body dementia, have been described in the neurons of the substantia nigra in many cases of Parkinson's disease associated with dementia. In previous studies we have described the morphological alterations in the synapses in the caudate nucleus and the globus pallidus in cases of Parkinson's disease. In the present study we attempted to describe the morphological and morphometric alterations of the locus coeruleus in patients who suffered from Parkinson's disease with normal cognitive function and in patients who suffered from Parkinson's disease associated with dementia, comparing them with normal controls. The morphological alterations of the neurons, the dendrites, the retrograde axonic collaterals and the synapses were more impressive in cases of Parkinson's disease associated with dementia than in Parkinson's disease with normal cognitive function. The majority of the synapses demonstrated changes in size and shape of the pre- and postsynaptic components, polymorphism of the synaptic vesicles and marked morphological alterations of the mitochondria. The morphological alterations of the synapses in cases of Parkinson's disease associated with dementia, plead in favor of the importance of the neuronal circuits of locus coeruleus in cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "The histologic hallmark of Parkinson disease (PD) is loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and locus ceruleus (LC) with accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alphaS). It has been reported that tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-negative pigmented neurons are present in these nuclei of patients with PD. However, the relationship between TH immunoreactivity and alphaS accumulation remains uncertain. We immunohistochemically examined the SN and LC from patients with PD (n = 10) and control subjects (n = 7). A correlation study indicated a close relationship among decreased TH immunoreactivity, alphaS accumulation, and neuronal loss. In addition, 10% of pigmented neurons in the SN and 54.9% of those in the LC contained abnormal alphaS aggregates. Moreover, 82.3% of pigmented neurons bearing alphaS aggregates in the SN and 39.2% of those in the LC lacked TH immunoreactivity, suggesting that pigmented neurons in the SN have a greater tendency to lack TH activity than those in the LC. Recent studies have shown that this decrease of TH activity leads to a decrease of cytotoxic substances and that decreased dopamine synthesis leads to a reduction of cytotoxic alphaS oligomers. Therefore, the decrease of TH immunoreactivity in pigmented neurons demonstrated here can be considered to represent a cytoprotective mechanism in PD.",

Cell numbers were estimated in the neuron-containing layers of CA1, CA2-(3), CA4, the dentate gyrus, and subiculum using the optical-fractionator technique. The Cavalieri method was used to estimate the volume of the total hippocampus and its subregions. We did not find significant differences in cell numbers or volumes in PD brains when compared with control subjects. Our results thus indicate that hippocampal atrophy and cell loss are not necessarily involved in the memory impairment and dementia observed in PD.",

    "abstract": "A comparative topographical immunohistochemical analysis was performed on the basal ganglia (including the substantia nigra) in Guamanian parkinsonism-dementia complex, idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The striatal projection neurons and their efferent fibers were examined by using antibodies to calcineurin, methionine-enkephalin, and substance P. Tyrosine hydroxylase served as a marker for nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The basal ganglia of patients with parkinsonism-dementia complex reacted strongly with all of the antibodies and the reaction products exhibited a normal distribution pattern. These findings suggest that the striatal output system is well preserved in patients with this disease. Similar results were obtained in patients with AD or PD. However, as compared to the patients with AD or PD, patients with parkinsonism-dementia complex showed severe reduction (greater than 90%) in the number of dopaminergic neurons in both the lateral and the medial portions of the substantia nigra. In view of the functional cortico-subcortical loops, these findings could explain the parkinsonian features and in part the cognitive impairment that occur in parkinsonism-dementia complex on Guam.",

    "abstract": "The striatum harbours a population of dopaminergic neurons that is thought to act as a local source of dopamine (DA). This neuronal population increases in size in animal models of Parkinson's disease, where striatal DA levels are low, but its fate in idiopathic Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea is poorly known. In this study, we used antibodies raised against the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a faithful marker of dopaminergic neurons, to compare, by means of stereological counting methods, the number of striatal TH+ neurons on post-mortem brain sections from Parkinson's disease patients, Huntington's disease patients and age-matched controls. Propidium iodide nuclear staining was also performed to avoid counting short TH+ axonal segments that bear a large swollen varicosity and resemble small bipolar neurons. In normal subjects, TH+ neurons were scattered throughout the striatum, but they abounded preferentially in the ventral portion of the structure and were more numerous in the putamen than in the caudate nucleus. They displayed a multipolar cell body of medium size (10-20 mum in diameter) that emitted 3-5 smooth dendrites, a typical characteristic of striatal interneurons. These TH+ cells were rarely found in the small TH-poor striosomes, most of them being embedded in the large TH-rich extrastriosomal matrix. The number of striatal TH+ neurons was also found to vary according to an inverse relation with the age of the subjects. In pathological brains, the morphological characteristics of the striatal TH+ neurons were relatively unaltered, but the number of such neurons was markedly reduced compared with controls. The striatum of Parkinson's disease patients was found to contain six times less TH+ neurons than that of controls, whereas the striatum of Huntington's disease patients was largely devoid of such neurons. These findings are at odds with the results obtained in rodent and monkey models of Parkinson's disease, in which the number of striatal TH+ neurons is reported to increase markedly following DA denervation. Since Parkinson's disease patients examined in this study were all treated with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to compensate for the loss of striatal DA and that levels of striatal DA are reportedly higher in the striatum of Huntington's disease patients compared with controls, we hypothesize that local DA concentrations exert a negative feedback on the expression of TH phenotype by striatal interneurons. A better knowledge of factors governing the in vivo state of this ectopic neuronal population could open new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea.",

    "abstract": "Substance P immunoreactive (SP+) neurons were analysed quantitatively in serial sections of the mesopontine tegmentum in 6 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 5 age-matched normal controls. In the tegmentum of the Parkinson's disease brains many SP+ neurons contained swollen, twisted neuronal processes as well as Lewy bodies. There were significant reductions in the total number of SP+ neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (loss 43%), in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (loss 28%), in the oral pontine reticular nucleus (loss 41%) and in the median raphe nucleus (loss 76%). It was the large SP+ (greater than 20 microns) neurons that were particularly affected. In our control group we did not document a significant relationship between age at death and number of SP+ neurons in these tegmental nuclei or between age at death and number of pigmented neurons in the locus coeruleus. In contrast, in patients with Parkinson's disease, there was a strong inverse relationship between age at death and numbers of SP+ and pigmented neurons. Our findings suggest an interaction between the pathophysiological mechanisms initiated by Parkinson's disease and other processes related to ageing. Since tegmental SP+ neurons are affected by the primary pathological processes underlying Parkinson's disease as severely as catecholamine-synthesizing neurons are affected, theories of pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies in Parkinson's disease will need to take into account the involvement of these SP+ neurons.",

    "abstract": "Neurons of the substantia nigra show severe morphological changes in Parkinson's disease. Pathological alterations of cell bodies have been described, whereas those of neuronal processes have hardly been investigated. Golgi impregnation has been the chosen method for demonstrating neuronal processes and dendritic and somatic spines. We therefore used the Golgi-Braitenberg method to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively study the substantia nigra of eight patients with Parkinson's disease compared with eight control cases. Golgi impregnation of substantia nigra neurons was good in all control cases. In full agreement with the analysis of Braak and Braak (1986) three neuronal types within the substantia nigra were found. In cases of Parkinson's disease, severe pathological changes such as decrease of dendritic length, loss of dendritic spines and several types of dendritic varicosities were found only in the melanin-containing pars compacta neurons. Pars reticulata nerve cells were intact. These findings support the predominant role played by the dopaminergic efferent pathway in the degenerative process. The afferent pathway was not affected. This suggests that the substantia nigra lesion is primary in Parkinson's disease. Loss of neurons found in H & E sections corresponded to a lesser amount of impregnated pars compacta neurons in cases with Parkinson's disease when compared to controls. Evidences exist that the duration of the disease may be related to the extent of pathologically altered Golgi-impregnated pars compacta cells. The amount of Lewy bodies in H & E sections corresponded to the quantity of round varicosities in impregnated pars compacta neurons. These round dendritic varicosities were considered to be Lewy body inclusions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin) system plays a central role in the regulation of various functions, including sleep/wake regulation and metabolism. There is a growing interest in hypocretin function in Parkinson's disease (PD), given the high prevalence of non-motor symptoms such as sleep disturbances in this disorder. However, studies measuring CSF hypocretin levels have yielded contradictory results. In PD patients and matched controls, we (i) estimated the number of hypocretin neurons in post-mortem hypothalami using immunocytochemistry and an image analysis system (ii) quantified hypocretin levels in post-mortem ventricular CSF and (iii) prefrontal cortex using a radioimmunoassay. Furthermore, presence of Lewy bodies was verified in the hypothalamic hypocretin cell area. Data are presented as median (25th-75th percentile). We showed a significant decrease between PD patients and controls in (i) the number of hypocretin neurons (PD: 20 276 (13 821-31 229); controls: 36 842 (32 546-50 938); P = 0.016); (ii) the hypocretin-1 concentration in post-mortem ventricular CSF (PD: 365.5 pg/ml (328.0-448.3); controls: 483.5 (433.5-512.3); P = 0.012) and (iii) the hypocretin-1 concentrations in prefrontal cortex (PD: 389.6 pg/g (249.2-652.2); controls: 676.6 (467.5-883.9); P = 0.043). Hypocretin neurotransmission is affected in PD. The hypocretin-1 concentration in the prefrontal cortex was almost 40% lower in PD patients, while ventricular CSF levels were almost 25% reduced. The total number of hypocretin neurons was almost half compared to controls.",

Neuronal counts were performed in defined areas of the medial and lateral substantia nigra (SNM, SNL), locus ceruleus (LC), and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The AR-type (compared with the T-type) showed higher neuronal loss of LC, SNL, SNM, and more severe gliosis, extraneuronal melanin deposits, and neuroaxonal dystrophy in substantia nigra. Demented PD patients showed more intense cortical Alzheimer lesions and higher neuronal depletion in the SNM, whereas PD subjects with moderate or marked dementia differed from mildly or not demented ones only in the higher degree of cortical Alzheimer lesions. More severe neuronal cell loss of DRN was observed in PD patients with depression. Occurrence of psychosis was not associated with any pathologic feature.

    "abstract": "It has recently been reported that Parkinson's disease (PD) is preceded and accompanied by daytime sleep attacks, nocturnal insomnia, REM sleep behaviour disorder, hallucinations and depression, symptoms which are frequently as troublesome as the motor symptoms of PD. All these symptoms are present in narcolepsy, which is linked to a selective loss of hypocretin (Hcrt) neurons. In this study, the Hcrt system was examined to determine if Hcrt cells are damaged in PD. The hypothalamus of 11 PD (mean age 79 +/- 4) and 5 normal (mean age 77 +/- 3) brains was examined. Sections were immunostained for Hcrt-1, melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) and alpha synuclein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The substantia nigra of 10 PD brains and 7 normal brains were used for a study of neuromelanin pigmented cell loss. The severity of PD was assessed using the Hoehn and Yahr scale and the level of neuropathology was assessed using the Braak staging criteria. Cell number, distribution and size were determined with stereologic techniques on a one in eight series. We found an increasing loss of hypocretin cells with disease progression. Similarly, there was an increased loss of MCH cells with disease severity. Hcrt and MCH cells were lost throughout the anterior to posterior extent of their hypothalamic distributions. The percentage loss of Hcrt cells was minimal in stage I (23%) and was maximal in stage V (62%). Similarly, the percentage loss of MCH cells was lowest in stage I (12%) and was highest in stage V (74%). There was a significant increase (P = 0.0006, t = 4.25, df = 15) in the size of neuromelanin containing cells in PD patients, but no difference in the size of surviving Hcrt (P = 0.18, t = 1.39, df = 14) and MCH (P = 0.28, t = 1.39, df = 14) cells relative to controls. In summary, we found that PD is characterized by a massive loss of Hcrt neurons. Thus, the loss of Hcrt cells may be a cause of the narcolepsy-like symptoms of PD and may be ameliorated by treatments aimed at reversing the Hcrt deficit. We also saw a substantial loss of hypothalamic MCH neurons. The losses of Hcrt and MCH neurons are significantly correlated with the clinical stage of PD, not disease duration, whereas the loss of neuromelanin cells is significantly correlated only with disease duration. The significant correlations that we found between the loss of Hcrt and MCH neurons and the clinical stage of PD, in contrast to the lack of a relationship of similar strength between loss of neuromelanin containing cells and the clinical symptoms of PD, suggests a previously unappreciated relationship between hypothalamic dysfunction and the time course of the overall clinical picture of PD.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a feature of both Lewy body disorders and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Since serotonergic neurons of the rostral raphe have been implicated in depression, we sought to determine whether there is a differential involvement of these neurons in cases with clinically diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or MSA. We studied the brainstem obtained at autopsy from fourteen patients with diagnosis of DLB and pathological limbic or neocortical stage Lewy body disease, 13 patients with clinical and neuropathological diagnosis of MSA, and 12 controls with no history of neurologic disease. The clinical features of these patients were analyzed retrospectively by reviewing their medical records. Serial sections were immunostained for tryptophan hydroxylase (TrOH) and alpha-synuclein and cell counts were performed in the dorsal raphe (DR), median raphe (MR) and medullary raphe nuclei. There was loss of serotonergic cells in both the DR and MR in DLB compared to control cases: For the DR, the number of cells/section were 53 +/- 6 in DLB versus 159 +/- 13 (P < 0.001) respectively, and for the MR 70 +/- 11 in DLB versus 173 +/- 23 (P < 0.001) respectively. In contrast, these cells were relatively preserved in MSA. The caudal raphe groups were affected both in MSA and in DLB. There is a differential involvement of raphe neurons in DLB and MSA. Although loss of rostral raphe neurons may contribute to depression in DLB, this appears to be less likely in MSA. Factors other than the neurochemical phenotype determine neuronal vulnerability in MSA.",

We carried out immunohistochemical studies using antibodies to calbindin (CALB) and calcineurin (CaN) as neurochemical markers for striatal medium spiny neurons. We found that in the caudal and dorsolateral putamen, the area most affected in MSA-P, the medium spiny neurons positive for CALB were severely depleted, while CaN-positive neurons were relatively spared in a mosaic pattern. In the dorsal caudate nucleus, an area less affected in MSA, residual CALB-positive neurons exhibited a compartmentalized distribution that corresponded with the striosomal arrangement visualized by Met-enkephalin immunostaining. Our findings suggest that there is a compartmental difference in the susceptibility of striatal medium spiny neurons to neurodegeneration in MSA-P.",

    "abstract": "Lewy bodies, the histologic hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), are detected in the brains of about 10% of clinically normal people over the age of 60 years. When Lewy bodies are found in normal individuals, the process is sometimes referred to as incidental Lewy body disease (iLBD). The distribution of Lewy bodies in iLBD is similar to the distribution in PD, but neuronal populations vulnerable to Lewy bodies do not show significant neuronal loss in iLBD. It remains unknown if Lewy bodies in this setting represent pre-symptomatic PD or an age-related change unrelated to PD. To address this question we identified cases of iLBD and used a marker for dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), to determine if there were changes similar to those found in PD. TH immunoreactivity in the striatum and the epicardial nerve fibers was decreased in iLBD compared to normal controls, but not to the same extent as in PD. The findings suggest that iLBD is preclinical PD and that the lack of symptoms is due to subthreshold pathology.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the relation between the loss of substantia nigra (SN) neurons in normal ageing and Parkinson's disease (PD), we measured the total number and the cell body volume of pigmented (neuromelanin) neurons in the SN. We examined young (n = 7, mean age: 19.9), middle-aged (n = 9, mean age: 50.1), and older controls from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (n = 7, mean age: 87.6), as well as PD cases (n = 8, mean age: 74.8). On random-systematically selected paraffin Nissl-stained sections, we used the Optical Fractionator to estimate the total number of neurons on one side of the SN. Using the Nucleator probe, we measured the volume of these neurons. In young and older controls, we also estimated the total number and volume of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive (+) nigral neurons. We observed a significant loss of pigmented (-28.3%, P < 0.01) and TH (+) (-36.2%, P < 0.001) neurons in older controls compared with younger subjects. Analysis of the size distribution of pigmented and TH (+) neurons showed a significant hypertrophy in older controls compared to young controls (P < 0.01). In contrast, in PD we observed a significant atrophy of pigmented neurons compared to all control groups (P < 0.01). These data suggest that neuronal hypertrophy represents a compensatory mechanism within individual SN neurons that allows for normal motor function despite the loss of neurons in normal ageing. Presumably, this compensatory mechanism breaks down or is overwhelmed by the pathological events of PD leading to the onset of the characteristic motor disturbances.",

    "abstract": "In a effort to better define the role cholinergic basal forebrain neurons play in human cognitive processes, a quantitative assessment of cholinergic nucleus basalis (Ch4) neurons was carried out in 5 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD; 4 non-demented and 1 demented) and 4 age-matched controls using nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor immunohistochemistry as a direct marker for cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. Virtually all (greater than 90%) NGF receptor-containing neurons co-localize with the specific cholinergic marker choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) within the nucleus basalis in PD. NGF receptor-containing neurons were reduced on average by 68% (range 38.6-87.4%) in the non-demented PD cases and by 88.6% in the demented PD patient. Loss of these neurons was heterogeneous across the nucleus basalis subfields with only the anterolateral and posterior Ch4 subregions demonstrating significant reductions of NGF receptor-containing neurons. The reduction in NGF receptor-containing neurons was accompanied by a decrease of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) containing fibers within temporal cortex and in some cases ChAT immunoreactivity in the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. The numerous non-cholinergic AChE-rich pyramidal cells which were observed throughout the cortex of aged controls were also virtually absent in PD. Although PD patients exhibited severe reductions in Ch4 neurons, few neuritic plaques or neurofibrillary tangles were observed within the PD cortex or Ch4 and similar numbers of these AD-type pathologies were seen within age-matched controls. This suggests that Ch4 degeneration alone is not sufficient to induce such cytoskeletal abnormalities and that the neuron loss seen within Ch4 in AD and PD may be mediated through different processes. These results, coupled with the extensive basic and clinical literature linking acetylcholine and memory function, further indicate that Ch4 degeneration without additional cortical and/or subcortical pathology is not sufficient to impair cognition in PD. Perhaps additional pathology must be superimposed upon nucleus basalis degeneration to induce dementia in humans.",

    "abstract": "Gender differences in dopaminergic related neurodegenerative diseases have hardly been studied until now. It is generally accepted that more men than women suffer from Parkinson's disease. One of the most prevalent symptoms in Parkinson's patients, hyposmia, does not show gender differences, while normally the sense of smell is better developed in females. Whether the change in dopamine in the olfactory bulb contributes equally to hyposmia in male and female Parkinson's patients is the subject of the present study. In a stereological study the total number of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons in the olfactory bulbs of male and female Parkinson's patients and age-matched controls has been estimated. The present stereological study shows that the number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells in control females is significantly lower than those in control males. The number of dopaminergic cells in the olfactory bulbs of both male and female Parkinson's patients equals that of healthy males of the same age group. We therefore conclude that the hyposmia in Parkinson's disease patients cannot simply be ascribed to dopamine in the olfactory bulb.",

    "abstract": "Although the intralaminar thalamus is a target of alpha-synuclein pathology in Parkinson's disease, the degree of neuronal loss in Lewy body diseases has not been assessed. We have used unbiased stereological techniques to quantify neuronal loss in intralaminar thalamic nuclei concentrating alpha-synuclein pathology (the anterodorsal, cucullar, parataenial, paraventricular, central medial, central lateral and centre-median/parafascicular complex) in different clinical forms of Lewy body disease (Parkinson's disease with and without dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies, N=21) compared with controls (N=5). Associations were performed in the Lewy body cases between intralaminar cell loss and the main diagnostic clinical (parkinsonism, dementia, fluctuation in consciousness, and visual hallucinations) and pathological (Braak stage of Parkinson's disease) features of these diseases, as well as between cell loss and the scaled severity of the alpha-synuclein deposition within the intralaminar thalamus. As expected, significant alpha-synuclein accumulation occurred in the intralaminar thalamus in the cases with Lewy body disease. Pathology concentrated anteriorly and in the central lateral and paraventricular nuclei was related to the Braak stage of Parkinson's disease, ageing, and the presence of dementia. Across all types of Lewy body cases there was substantial atrophy and neuronal loss in the central lateral, cucullar and parataenial nuclei, and neuronal loss without atrophy in the centre-median/parafascicular complex. Cases with visual hallucinations showed a greater degree of atrophy of the cucullar nucleus, possibly due to amygdala denervation. The significant degeneration demonstrated in the intralaminar thalamus is likely to contribute to the movement and cognitive dysfunction observed in Lewy body disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is thought to cause degeneration of melanin-pigmented catecholaminergic neurons throughout the brainstem, but little quantitative information is available on the fate of catecholaminergic neurons associated with the dorsal vagal complex or medullary reticular formation. We therefore examined these neurons in the normal human medulla and in the brains of patients with Parkinson's disease, using both a melanin stain and immunohistochemical methods with an antiserum against tyrosine hydroxylase. The greatest numbers of catecholaminergic neurons in the ventrolateral reticular formation (A1/C1 group) were located in the far rostral medulla, whereas the largest populations of catecholaminergic cells in the dorsal vagal complex (A2/C2 group) were found at the level of the area postrema. No loss of cells was observed in the A1/C1 group in the parkinsonian brains. In contrast, the A2/C2 group showed moderate loss of neurons, most marked at the level of the area postrema. This difference was entirely due to the loss of neurons in the medial component of the A2 group, a population that normally is only lightly pigmented, while the heavily pigmented neurons in the ventral and intermediate components of the A2 complex were unaffected. Parkinson's disease causes degeneration only of selected populations of medullary catecholaminergic neurons, without apparent relationship to the extent of melanin pigmentation.",

    "abstract": "Based on 45 normal cases aged from 32 to 106 years of age, a morphometric study revealed that, despite decrease in the number of both pigmented neurons (PN) and the non-pigmented neurons (NN) with advancing age, the ratio (PN/NN) did not change (4.8). It is well-known that both the substantia nigra and the striatum send fibers to each other. McGee demonstrated that the ratio of the number of large neurons to that of small neurons was constant, irrespective of different ages, although number of both neurons decreased with ageing. It was therefore apparent that this phenomenon in the putamen was the same as in the substantia nigra. It could be considered that \"balanced depopulation of different neurons\" in the nucleus of the strio-nigral circuit contribute to support normal extrapyramidal functions. Additionally, the centenarian cases showed larger numbers of both PN and NN than younger case. It was likely that they could be classified as so-called \"excellent\" centenarians. On the other hand, idiopathic Parkinson's disease (15 cases) showed that while the same number of NN remained as in age-matched controls, PN showed marked depopulation. Olivopontocerebellar atrophy of the sporadic type (OPCA, 10 cases) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, 5 cases) showed a decrease in number of both PN and NN. However, NN in PSP showed much more decrease than OPCA. NN sends fibers to the pontine tegmentum as well as the thalamus, and PSP shows marked atrophy of the brainstem tegmentum. In this connection, it was considered that marked decrease of NN in PSP could be related to tegmental atrophy.",

    "abstract": "The micro-architecture of the substantia nigra was studied in control cases of varying age and patients with parkinsonism. A single 7 mu section stained with haematoxylin and eosin was examined at a specific level within the caudal nigra using strict criteria. The pars compacta was divided into a ventral and a dorsal tier, and each tier was further subdivided into 3 regions. In 36 control cases there was a linear fallout of pigmented neurons with advancing age in the pars compacta of the caudal substantia nigra at a rate of 4.7% per decade. Regionally, the lateral ventral tier was relatively spared (2.1% loss per decade) compared with the medial ventral tier (5.4%) and the dorsal tier (6.9%). In 20 Parkinson's disease (PD) cases of varying disease duration there was an exponential loss of pigmented neurons with a 45% loss in the first decade. Regionally, the pattern was opposite to ageing. Loss was greatest in the lateral ventral tier (average loss 91%) followed by the medial ventral tier (71%) and the dorsal tier (56%). The presymptomatic phase of PD from the onset of neuronal loss was estimated to be about 5 yrs. This phase is represented by incidental Lewy body cases: individuals who die without clinical signs of PD or dementia, but who are found to have Lewy bodies at post-mortem. In 7 cases cell loss was confined to the lateral ventral tier (average loss 52%) congruent with the lateral ventral selectivity of symptomatic PD. It was calculated that at the onset of symptoms there was a 68% cell loss in the lateral ventral tier and a 48% loss in the caudal nigra as a whole. The regional selectivity of PD is relatively specific. In 15 cases of striatonigral degeneration the distribution of cell loss was similar, but the loss in the dorsal tier was greater than PD by 21%. In 14 cases of Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome (SRO) there was no predilection for the lateral ventral tier, but a tendency to involve the medial nigra and spare the lateral. These findings suggest that age-related attrition of pigmented nigral cells is not an important factor in the pathogenesis of PD.",

Using anti-TH and/or anti-ubiquitin antibodies, we evaluated the cerebral cortices included superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, cuneus, cingulate gyrus, short and long gyri of insula, and parahippocampal gyrus from 18 autopsy cases of Parkinson's disease and 16 controls. The appearance of TH-IR neurons in cerebral cortices was suggestive of non-pyramidal interneurons. The mean number of TH-IR neurons and the density of TH-IR fibers in Parkinson's disease were decreased in comparison with the controls. The cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease has been accounted for by the lesions of the basal nucleus of Meynert, the locus ceruleus, and the cortical Lewy bodies in the cerebral cortex. In addition to these lesions, the global loss of non-pyramidal TH-IR cortical neurons and TH-IR fibers would induce the dysfunction of higher-order control of the neocortex and the limbic system in Parkinson's disease. Double-immunostaining with anti-TH and anti-ubiquitin antibodies did not show the TH-IR neuron with cortical Lewy body in the cerebral cortices of Parkinson's disease. In the cerebral cortices of Parkinson's disease, TH-IR non-pyramidal neurons in which cortical Lewy body is not formed decreased in number.",

The pontine noradrenergic locus ceruleus showed variable degrees of degeneration. There was also a substantial loss of substance P-containing neurons in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus. However, the most severely affected cell group in the pons was the serotonin-synthesizing neurons in the median raphe. In the medulla, substantial neuronal loss was found in several diverse cell groups including the adrenaline-synthesizing and neuropeptide Y-containing neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, the serotonin-synthesizing neurons in the raphe obscurus nucleus, the substance P-containing neurons in the lateral reticular formation, as well as the substance P-containing neurons in the dorsal motor vagal nucleus. Lewy bodies were present in immunohistochemically identified neurons in many of these regions, indicating that they were affected directly by the disease process. These widespread but region- and transmitter-specific changes help account for the diversity of motor, cognitive, and autonomic manifestations of Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether variable thalamic degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) contributes to less drug responsive clinical features. Formalin-fixed thalami from longitudinally followed patients with PD and early dystonia (N = 6), early falls (N = 5) or no dystonia or falls (N = 6) and age-matched controls without neuropathology (N = 10) were serially sectioned, stained, and analyzed. Neurons in the centromedian parafascicular (CM-Pf) nucleus were quantified using the optical disector method and analysis of variance with post hoc testing used to determine variability in neurodegeneration between groups. Patients with PD were confirmed to have significant neurodegeneration in the CM-Pf complex, with no difference in the degree of neurodegeneration between patients with PD with early falls compared with patients with no history of falls or dystonia. In contrast, patients with PD with early dystonia had significantly less neurodegeneration of the CM but not the Pf than patients without this feature. Preservation of the CM in patients with PD with early dystonia would result in a relative increase in CM activity through the direct basal ganglia pathway and increased primary motor cortex activity. Overall this data provides evidence for pathway-specific neurodegeneration as an underlying feature of the clinical variability observed in patients with PD.",

The estimated total number of TH-positive neurons in the A1 and the A2 regions was normal in PD and PSP patients. The sparing of medullary catecholaminergic cells in PD and PSP may be related to their minor degree of melanization and the possibility that intermediate compounds associated with the oxidative catabolism of norepinephrine and epinephrine may be less cytotoxic than those generated by degradation of dopamine. Patients with SND showed a marked loss of TH-immunoreactive cells in the A1 and the A2 groups, which may contribute to the impairment of vasomotor control characteristic of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Using an unbiased stereological technique, the total numbers of pigmented and non-pigmented neurons were estimated in the substantia nigra of seven patients with Parkinson's disease and seven control patients. Compared with the controls, in which the average total number of pigmented neurons was 550,000, the number of neurons was reduced by 66% in the patients. The average total number of non-pigmented neurons was 260,000 in controls and reduced by 24% in the patients. A significant correlation (r = 0.81) existed between the total numbers of pigmented and non-pigmented neurons in the controls, whereas a similar correlation (r = 0.72) in the patients fell just short of statistical significance. The stereological estimates made in this study are unbiased, in that they are independent of nerve cell size, section thickness and of dimensional changes in brain tissue induced by histological procedures. The stereological method is considerably more efficient than previous conventional methods.",

    "abstract": "Dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) occurs in dopaminergic neurones in the SN in PD and it is associated with Lewy body formation. However, it remains unknown whether this is specific to PD or whether it also occurs in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) where nigral dopaminergic neurones also degenerate. In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression of proteasomal subunits in the SN in PD, MSA and PSP. Immunohistochemistry double staining showed that proteasome 20S-alpha4 and -alpha6, and 20S-beta3 and -beta5i subunits are colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the SN of control, PD, MSA and PSP brain. Semi-quantitative analysis showed a significant loss of 20S-alpha4 and -alpha6 subunits TH-positive cells in PD, MSA and PSP compared to control tissue. There was no change in the expression of 20S-beta3 and -beta5i subunits in any of the disease states. The expression of PA700-Rpt5 subunits was not changed in PSP or PD but was significantly increased in MSA compared to control SN. PA700-Rpn10 subunit was not colocalized with TH within dopamine cells but was co-expressed with glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) positive astrocytes in the SN of all groups. PA28-alpha immunoreactivity was low in TH positive neurones in control tissue and quantification was not possible. Qualitative analysis suggested a decrease in PD and no immunoreactivity was detected in MSA or PSP. The results show that changes in proteasomal structure occur in the SN in PD, MSA and PSP and that these are similar in nature suggesting that dysfunction of UPS is not specific to PD or to Lewy body formation.",

    "abstract": "Gait disorders and postural instability, which are commonly observed in elderly patients with Parkinson disease (PD), respond poorly to dopaminergic agents used to treat other parkinsonian symptoms. The brain structures underlying gait disorders and falls in PD and aging remain to be characterized. Using functional MRI in healthy human subjects, we have shown here that activity of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which is composed of the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the adjacent cuneiform nucleus, was modulated by the speed of imagined gait, with faster imagined gait activating a discrete cluster within the MLR. Furthermore, the presence of gait disorders in patients with PD and in aged monkeys rendered parkinsonian by MPTP intoxication correlated with loss of PPN cholinergic neurons. Bilateral lesioning of the cholinergic part of the PPN induced gait and postural deficits in nondopaminergic lesioned monkeys. Our data therefore reveal that the cholinergic neurons of the PPN play a central role in controlling gait and posture and represent a possible target for pharmacological treatment of gait disorders in PD.",

Severe neuronal loss and tangle formation were evident in the anterodorsal nucleus from the AD cases. Nerve cell damage was also present in the centromedian nucleus but was not associated with tangle formation and occurred in all but 2 of the brains examined. It is likely that the anterodorsal neurons are damaged locally by the Alzheimer's disease process whereas the changes in the centromedian nucleus may be related to ageing.",

    "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), there is a significant loss of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in addition to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). The goal of this study was to determine if the surviving LC noradrenergic neurons in PD demonstrate compensatory changes in response to the neuronal loss, as observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) mRNA expression in postmortem LC tissue of control and age-matched PD subjects demonstrated a significant reduction in the number of noradrenergic neurons in the LC of PD subjects. TH mRNA expression/neuron did not differ between control and PD subjects, but DBH mRNA expression/neuron was significantly elevated in PD subjects compared to control. This increase in DBH mRNA expression in PD subjects is not a response to neuronal loss because the amount of DBH mRNA expression/neuron in AD subjects was not significantly different from control. Norepinephrine transporter (NET) binding site concentration in the LC of PD subjects was significantly reduced over the cell body region as well as the peri-LC dendritic zone. In PD subjects, the loss of dendrites from surviving noradrenergic neurons was also apparent with TH-immunoreactivity (IR). This loss of LC dendritic innervation in PD subjects as measured by TH-IR was not due to LC neuronal loss because TH-IR in AD subjects was robust, despite a similar loss of LC neurons. These data suggest that there is a differential response of the noradrenergic nervous system in PD compared to AD in response to the loss of LC neurons.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent and early feature of patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) and is very uncommon in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mechanisms underlying this clinical manifestation are poorly understood but the premature deposition of protein aggregates in the olfactory bulb (OB) of these patients might impair its synaptic organization, thus accounting for the smell deficits. Tau, β-amyloid and alpha-synuclein deposits were studied in 41 human OBs with histological diagnosis of AD (n = 24), PD (n = 6), FTD (n = 11) and compared with the OB of 15 control subjects. Tau pathology was present in the OB of all patients, irrespective of the histological diagnosis, while β-amyloid and alpha-synuclein protein deposit were frequently observed in AD and PD, respectively. Using stereological techniques we found an increased number of dopaminergic periglomerular neurons in the OB of AD, PD and FTD patients when compared with age-matched controls. Moreover, volumetric measurements of OBs showed a significant decrease only in AD patients, while the OB volume was similar to control in PD or FTD cases. The increased dopaminergic tone created in the OBs of these patients could reflect a compensatory mechanism created by the early degeneration of other neurotransmitter systems and might contribute to the olfactory dysfunction exhibited by patients with neurodegenerative disorders.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to our vast knowledge of the dopamine (DA) system, much less is known about the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in neurodegenerative diseases affecting the basal ganglia. Therefore, we designed a study that aimed at characterizing the status of the striatal DA and 5-HT systems in patients who suffered from either Parkinson's (PD) or Huntington's disease (HD), compared to age-matched controls. Antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and 5-HT transporter (SERT) were used as markers of DA and 5-HT axonal profiles, respectively. The density and pattern of TH+ and SERT + innervation were determined by optical density measurements as well as by direct stereological estimates of labeled axon varicosities. The results reveal a significant decrease in TH immunoreactivity and TH + axon terminals throughout the striatum in both PD and HD, whereas the intensity of SERT immunostaining and the density of SERT + axon varicosities were found to be slightly increased in the striatum of PD and HD patients compared to controls. These findings reveal that the nigrostriatal DA system is significantly impaired in both PD and HD compared to the striatal 5-HT innervation, which is slightly increased in these two conditions. The striatal 5-HT augmentation observed in PD might be the result of a neural mechanism designed to compensate for DA denervation, whereas the marked atrophy of the striatum might explain the increase in the 5-HT innervation noted in HD. These findings underline the importance of the complex interplay between DA and 5-HT striatal afferents in the elaboration of appropriate motor behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of calbindin-D28K (CaBP)-positive neurons was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 4 controls, 5 cases of Parkinson's disease and a single case of strionigral degeneration. CaBP-positive neurons were preferentially localized to the mediodorsal portion of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) in the beta layer, while CaBP-negative, melanin-positive neurons were concentrated in the ventrolateral SNC in the alpha layer. In Parkinson's disease and the case of strionigral degeneration, there was a relative sparing of the CaBP-positive neurons compared with CaBP-negative, pigmented neurons. These data imply that CaBP may confer some protection to SNC dopaminergic neurons against the pathological process which is responsible for Parkinson's disease and strionigral degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal dysfunction is a prominent non-motor feature of Parkinson's disease (PD) that contributes directly to the morbidity of patients, complicates management of motor symptoms, and may herald incipient PD in patients without motor disability. Although PD has traditionally been considered a disease of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, analyses of gastrointestinal samples from PD patients have consistently revealed pathology in the enteric nervous system. The relationship of PD pathology to GI dysmotility is poorly understood, and this lack of understanding has led to limited success in developing treatments for PD-related GI symptoms. We have quantitatively compared myenteric neuron density and relative abundance of NO, VIP, and catecholamine neurons between patients with PD and control individuals along the length of the GI tract. In addition, we have examined the frequency of GI α-synuclein neuritic pathology and its co-localization with the same neuronal markers. We have included a comparison with a small population of patients with incidental Lewy bodies found at autopsy. These data indicate that there is no neuronal loss in the myenteric plexus in PD. Lewy body pathology parallels parasympathetic autonomic input from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, not the distribution of extrinsic sympathetic input or intrinsic enteric neurons, and is only rarely co-localized with tyrosine hydroxylase. These data provide a critical background to which further analyses of the effect of PD on the GI tract may be compared and suggest that neuropathology in myenteric neurons is unlikely to be a causative factor in PD-related GI dysmotility.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of brain tissue in a recently identified group of elderly demented patients suggest a neurochemical basis for some of the clinical features. Senile dementia of the Lewy body type (SDLT) can be distinguished from classical Alzheimer disease (AD) clinically by its acute presentation with confusion frequently accompanied by visual hallucinations, and neuropathologically by the presence of Lewy bodies and senile plaques (but not generally neurofibrillary tangles) in the cerebral cortex. Reductions in the cortical cholinergic enzyme choline acetyltransferase were more pronounced in individuals with (80%) compared to those without (50%) hallucinations and correlated strongly with mental test scores in the group as a whole. In the caudate nucleus, dopamine levels were related to the number of neurons in the substantia nigra, there being a 40-60% loss of both in SDLT--probably accounting for mild extrapyramidal features in some of these cases--compared with an 80% loss in Parkinson disease and no change in AD. The cholinergic correlates of mental impairment in SDLT together with the relative absence of cortical neurofibrillary tangles and evidence for postsynaptic cholinergic receptor compensation raise the question of whether this type of dementia may be more amenable to cholinotherapy than classical AD.",

    "abstract": "The pace of nigrostriatal degeneration, both with regards to striatal denervation and loss of melanin and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, is poorly understood especially early in the Parkinson's disease process. This study investigated the extent of nigrostriatal degeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease at different disease durations from time of diagnosis. Brains of patients with Parkinson's disease (n=28) with post-diagnostic intervals of 1-27 years and normal elderly control subjects (n=9) were examined. Sections of the post-commissural putamen and substantia nigra pars compacta were processed for tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter immunohistochemistry. The post-commissural putamen was selected due to tissue availability and the fact that dopamine loss in this region is associated with motor disability in Parkinson's disease. Quantitative assessments of putaminal dopaminergic fibre density and stereological estimates of the number of melanin-containing and tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (both in total and in subregions) were performed by blinded investigators in cases where suitable material was available (n=17). Dopaminergic markers in the dorsal putamen showed a modest loss at 1 year after diagnosis in the single case available for study. There was variable (moderate to marked) loss, at 3 years. At 4 years post-diagnosis and thereafter, there was virtually complete loss of staining in the dorsal putamen with only an occasional abnormal dopaminergic fibre detected. In the substantia nigra pars compacta, there was a 50-90% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons from the earliest time points studied with only marginal additional loss thereafter. There was only a ∼10% loss of melanized neurons in the one case evaluated 1 year post-diagnosis, and variable (30 to 60%) loss during the first several years post-diagnosis with more gradual and subtle loss in the second decade. At all time points, there were more melanin-containing than tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells. Loss of dopaminergic markers in the dorsal putamen occurs rapidly and is virtually complete by 4 years post-diagnosis. Loss of melanized nigral neurons lags behind the loss of dopamine markers. These findings have important implications for understanding the nature of Parkinson's disease neurodegeneration and for studies of putative neuroprotective/restorative therapies.",

    "abstract": "It has recently been shown that expression of the rate-limiting GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) is decreased in Brodmann area 9 (BA9) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in Parkinson's disease (PD) compared to control brains (Lanoue, A.C., Dumitriu, A., Myers, R.H., Soghomonian, JJ., 2010. Exp. Neurol. 206 (1), 207-217). A subpopulation of cortical GABAergic interneurons expresses the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin and plays a critical role in the control of pyramidal neuron excitability and the generation of cortical gamma frequency oscillations. In view of its key role in the physiology of the cerebral cortex, we sought to determine whether the expression of parvalbumin and the number of parvalbumin-expressing neurons are altered in BA9 of PD brains. First, isotopic in situ hybridization histochemistry was used to examine mRNA expression of parvalbumin on post-mortem brain sections. Second, immunohistochemistry and design-based stereology were used to determine the density of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in BA9. Quantification of mRNA labeling at the single cell level showed a significant decrease in parvalbumin expression in PD cases. In contrast, neuronal density of parvalbumin-positive neurons was not significantly different between PD and controls. Results confirm that the GABAergic system is altered in the DLPFC in PD and identify the contribution of parvalbumin-expressing neurons in these alterations. We speculate that these effects could contribute to altered cortical excitability and oscillatory activity previously documented in PD. ",

    "abstract": "The α-synuclein-immunoreactive pathology of dementia associated with Parkinson disease (DPD) comprises Lewy bodies (LB), Lewy neurites (LN), and Lewy grains (LG). The densities of LB, LN, LG together with vacuoles, neurons, abnormally enlarged neurons (EN), and glial cell nuclei were measured in fifteen cases of DPD. Densities of LN and LG were up to 19 and 70 times those of LB, respectively, depending on region. Densities were significantly greater in amygdala, entorhinal cortex (EC), and sectors CA2/CA3 of the hippocampus, whereas middle frontal gyrus, sector CA1, and dentate gyrus were least affected. Low densities of vacuoles and EN were recorded in most regions. There were differences in the numerical density of neurons between regions, but no statistical difference between patients and controls. In the cortex, the density of LB and vacuoles was similar in upper and lower laminae, while the densities of LN and LG were greater in upper cortex. The densities of LB, LN, and LG were positively correlated. Principal components analysis suggested that DPD cases were heterogeneous with pathology primarily affecting either hippocampus or cortex. The data suggest in DPD: (1) ratio of LN and LG to LB varies between regions, (2) low densities of vacuoles and EN are present in most brain regions, (3) degeneration occurs across cortical laminae, upper laminae being particularly affected, (4) LB, LN and LG may represent degeneration of the same neurons, and (5) disease heterogeneity may result from variation in anatomical pathway affected by cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein.

    "abstract": "Cholinergic neuronal loss in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) associates with abnormal functions, including certain motor and nonmotor symptoms. This realization has led to low-frequency stimulation of the PPN for treating patients with Parkinson disease (PD) who are refractory to other treatment modalities. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PPN neuronal loss and the therapeutic substrate for the clinical benefits following PPN stimulation remain poorly characterized, hampering progress toward designing more efficient therapies aimed at restoring the PPN's normal functions during progressive parkinsonism. Here, we investigated postmortem pathological changes in the PPN of PD cases. Our study detected a loss of neurons producing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as their output and glycinergic neurons, along with the pronounced loss of cholinergic neurons. These losses were accompanied by altered somatic cell size that affected the remaining neurons of all neuronal subtypes studied here. Because studies showed that mitochondrial dysfunction exists in sporadic PD and in PD animal models, we investigated whether altered mitochondrial composition exists in the PPN. A significant up-regulation of several mitochondrial proteins was seen in GABAergic and glycinergic neurons; however, cholinergic neurons indicated down-regulation of the same proteins. Our findings suggest an imbalance in the activity of key neuronal subgroups of the PPN in PD, potentially because of abnormal inhibitory activity and altered cholinergic outflow.",

    "abstract": "There is a cholinergic deficit in Parkinson disease (PD) and in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) that plays a role in a variety of clinical symptoms, including visual hallucinations (VH). The aim of this study was to assess cholinergic neuronal loss and PD and Alzheimer disease pathology in the pedunculopontine nucleus pars compacta (PPNc) of PD and DLB patients with VH. Postmortem brainstem tissue samples of 9 clinically diagnosed and pathologically confirmed PD patients with VH, 9 DLB patients with VH, and 9 age- and sex-matched nondemented controls were obtained from the Netherlands Brain Bank. Using a morphometric approach, we estimated the density of cholinergic neurons in the PPNc and determined the local load of α-synuclein-immunoreactive Lewy pathology, neurofibrillary tangles, and β-amyloid plaques. Cholinergic cell density in the PPNc was significantly lower in PD compared with DLB patients with VH (-39%, p < 0.001) and controls (-41%, p < 0.001). Alpha-synuclein load was higher in PD, whereas β-amyloid plaque pathology was more pronounced in DLB patients. The mean cell density in DLB patients was not significantly reduced compared with that in controls. These results may indicate different patterns of degeneration of cholinergic output structures in PD and DLB.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia and substantia nigra, taken from control human brain and from patients dying with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease or Huntington's chorea, were analysed with histochemical and biochemical techniques. The pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta possess tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and are disposed in three major layers, alpha, beta and gamma. This pattern became obscured in choreic brains by the severe shrinkage of the nigra, but total numbers of pigmented neurons were within the normal range. In contrast, pigmented neurons were lost from all layers of the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, although examination of cases with minimal cell loss suggested that an internal part of the lateral alpha sub-layer was most severely and consistently affected. A dopaminergic projection between this internal part of the alpha sub-layer and the putamen was suggested by the preferential loss of catecholamines from the putamen in Parkinson's disease. The distribution of the peptides, substance P, methionine-enkephalin and dynorphin 1-17 were mapped immunohistochemically within the substantia nigra. The different patterns of immunoreactive axons and terminals were found to be extensive, at least partially overlapping, and largely avoided the region of the pigmented perikarya of the alpha sub-layer and nucleus paranigralis. All peptides were depleted in choreic substantia nigra, reflecting the degeneration of the striatonigral pathway. However, concentrations of enkephalin-like immunoreactivity were increased within the interpeduncular nucleus. In Parkinson's disease there was a loss of enkephalin- and dynorphin-like immunoreactivity from the substantia nigra but a fall in substance P-like immunoreactivity was only detected by radioimmunoassay, not by immunocytochemistry. Peptide immunoreactivity was also reduced within choreic basal ganglia. However, no gross changes were found in peptide staining of the parkinsonian basal ganglia. In summary we have reported a number of changes in peptide-containing pathways in human degenerative disorders that may reflect the degeneration of neuronal pathways either as a primary event or secondary to initial lesion. We have also emphasized the sensitivity of the alpha sub-layer of nigral neurons to damage in Parkinson's disease. We suggest that the lower density of peptidergic fibres in the area of the perikarya may contribute to the susceptibility of these neurons to damage.",

    "abstract": "This study summarizes the findings from postmortem examination of the brains of 22 control cases without neurological deficit, 12 cases of senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), and nine cases of Parkinson's disease (three without signs of intellectual deterioration, four with dementia, and two atypical with dementia nonresponsive to L-dopa treatment). The aim of this study was to find the similarities and differences in galanin innervation of the cholinergic basal nucleus neurons in these dementing disorders as compared with controls. Immunocytochemistry with antibodies against galanin peptide and against choline acetyltransferase was applied on perfused brain preparations. Galanin peptide is present in the basal nucleus of Meynert neuron networks in the normal human brain: in local circuit neurons, in a number of galanin/cholinergic neurons, and in a feedback circuit via collaterals) that terminate upon the cholinergic neuronal somata and dendrites. Thus, peptide galanin circuits could function as powerful modulators of the activities of basal nucleus cholinergic neurons, both within the basal forebrain and in their wider projections to the neocortex and amygdala. As galanin has been shown to inhibit cholinergic activity, this galanin network could suppress the activity of cholinergic neurons. In SDAT, there is a primary loss of cholinergic neurons compounded by a secondary reaction of the remaining cholinergic neurons to the terminal degeneration in the cortex. Galanin networks demonstrate an inverse relationship to the cholinergic cell loss. Galanin axons hypertrophy and hyperinnervate the remaining cholinergic neurons. In Parkinson's disease the loss of cholinergic neurons is accentuated by the presence of dementia: the hypertrophy of the galanin axonal networks on cholinergic neurons is dramatic in Parkinson's disease with dementia. These observations throw new light on the neurotransmitter bases for these dementias. Galanin controls cholinergic mechanisms in the basal nucleus of Meynert, and dementia is accompanied by augmentation of galanin innervation onto an already depressed population of cholinergic neurons, thus demonstrating an appreciable amount of plasticity even in aged brain. These findings suggest that the present therapy of cholinergic enhancement as a means to retard intellectual deterioration can by itself have little effect at best, in these dementias. The suppressive effect of galanin peptide has to be reduced or curtailed, perhaps concurrently with the treatment of the cholinergic deficit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Hypocretin (Hcrt) is a neuropeptide synthesized in the lateral hypothalamus (LHT) that plays a key role in maintaining arousal state. In Parkinson's disease (PD), a narcolepsy-like syndrome is commonly seen, and a previous study showed substantial Hcrt neuronal loss in accordance with PD severity. In the present study, we quantitatively examined Hcrt immunoreactivity and α-synuclein and tau pathologies in the LHT and locus coeruleus (LC) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (n=15), Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n=14), and controls (n=7). In the LHT, substantial Hcrt-positive neurons were detected in controls. In contrast, in DLB and AD, the numbers of both total neurons and Hcrt-positive neurons were significantly reduced. The reduction of the latter was significantly severer in DLB than in AD. In the LC of controls, many Hcrt-positive axonal terminals were found. In contrast, the amount of Hcrt immunoreactivity was significantly reduced both in DLB and AD. In DLB, some Lewy body (LB)-bearing neurons were detected in the LHT, but the Hcrt-positive neurons did not have any LBs. Meanwhile, some tau-positive neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)-bearing neurons were detected in the LHT, and Hcrt-positive neurons occasionally contained NFTs. We observed a significant negative correlation between the number of Hcrt-positive neurons in the LHT and the neurofibrillary stage (r=-0.67, p=0.0067), whereas no significant correlation was found between the number of Hcrt-positive neurons and the Lewy stage (r=-0.47, p=0.077). This is the first report clarifying the substantial loss of Hcrt neurons in the LHT and of Hcrt axonal terminals in the LC in DLB and the correlation between the severity of Hcrt neuronal loss and progression of neurofibrillary pathology.

    "abstract": "To gain a better understanding of the significance of α-synuclein pathological conditions during disease progression in Parkinson's disease, we investigated whether 1) nigral neuronal loss in incidental Lewy body disease and Parkinson's disease donors is associated with the local burden α-synuclein pathological conditions during progression of pathological conditions; 2) the burden and distribution of α-synuclein pathological conditions are related to clinical measures of disease progression. Post-mortem tissue and medical records of 24 Parkinson's disease patients, 20 incidental Lewy body disease donors, and 12 age-matched controls were obtained from the Netherlands Brain Bank for morphometric analysis. We observed a 20% decrease in nigral neuronal cell density in incidental Lewy body disease compared with controls. Nigral neuronal loss (12%) was already observed before the appearance α-synuclein aggregates. The progression from Braak α-synuclein stage 3 to 4 was associated with a significant decline in neuronal cell density (46%). Nigral neuronal loss increased with later Braak α-synuclein stages but did not vary across consecutive Braak α-synuclein stages. We observed a negative correlation between neuronal density and local α-synuclein burden in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients (ρ = -0.54), but no relationship with Hoehn & Yahr stage or disease duration. In conclusion, our findings cast doubt on the pathogenic role of α-synuclein aggregates in elderly, but do suggest that the severity of neurodegeneration and local burden of α-synuclein pathological conditions are closely coupled during disease progression in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The neuropathological substrate of dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease is still under debate, particularly in patients with insufficient alternate neuropathology for other degenerative dementias. In patients with pure Lewy body Parkinson's disease, previous post-mortem studies have shown that dopaminergic and cholinergic regulatory projection systems degenerate, but the exact pathways that may explain the development of dementia in patients with Parkinson's disease remain unclear. Studies in rodents suggest that both the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic and septohippocampal cholinergic pathways may functionally interact to regulate certain aspects of cognition, however, whether such an interaction occurs in humans is still poorly understood. In this study, we performed stereological analyses of the A9 and A10 dopaminergic neurons and Ch1, Ch2 and Ch4 cholinergic neurons located in the basal forebrain, along with an assessment of α-synuclein pathology in these regions and in the hippocampus of six demented and five non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease and five age-matched control individuals with no signs of neurological disease. Moreover, we measured choline acetyltransferase activity in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of eight demented and eight non-demented patients with Parkinson's disease, as well as in the same areas of eight age-matched controls. All patients with Parkinson's disease exhibited a similar 80-85% loss of pigmented A9 dopaminergic neurons, whereas patients with Parkinson's disease dementia presented an additional loss in the lateral part of A10 dopaminergic neurons as well as Ch4 nucleus basalis neurons. In contrast, medial A10 dopaminergic neurons and Ch1 and Ch2 cholinergic septal neurons were largely spared. Despite variable Ch4 cell loss, cortical but not hippocampal cholinergic activity was consistently reduced in all patients with Parkinson's disease, suggesting significant dysfunction in cortical cholinergic pathways before frank neuronal degeneration. Patients with Parkinson's disease dementia were differentiated by a significant reduction in hippocampal cholinergic activity, by a significant loss of non-pigmented lateral A10 dopaminergic neurons and Ch4 cholinergic neurons (30 and 55% cell loss, respectively, compared with neuronal preservation in control subjects), and by an increase in the severity of α-synuclein pathology in the basal forebrain and hippocampus. Overall, these results point to increasing α-synuclein deposition and hippocampal dysfunction in a setting of more widespread degeneration of cortical dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways as contributing to the dementia occurring in patients with pure Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, our findings support the concept that α-synuclein deposition is associated with significant neuronal dysfunction in the absence of frank neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "A retrospective study of 269 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome was carried out. Seventy-eight were selected as cases of Parkinson's disease on the basis of generally accepted criteria. Of these, 73 were found to have Lewy bodies and cell loss in the substantia nigra, two had the pathological changes of striatonigral degeneration, two had extensive neurofibrillary tangles and nigral cell loss compatible with post-encephalitic parkinsonian syndrome, and one had Lewy bodies and striatonigral degeneration. Pathological examination of the remaining brains revealed Lewy bodies with cell loss in the nigra, a different pathological diagnosis, or normal basal ganglia. No unclassifiable 'senile' patients, or cases with neurofibrillary tangle degeneration or extranigral pathology of unknown cause were found. As a result of these findings clinico-pathological diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease are proposed. All patients with this diagnosis had Lewy bodies in surviving neurons of two unilateral 7 microns sections of the mid-part of the substantia nigra. The frequency of Lewy bodies in multiple system atrophy, Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome and Alzheimer's disease was low and similar to that in age-matched 'normal' controls. Pathological findings were compatible with the notion that these individuals have preclinical or coincidental Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Regional neuronal loss in the substantia nigra was studied in relation to extrapyramidal symptoms and dementia in 12 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and in 18 control subjects. Four areas of the right substantia nigra were investigated at the level of the superior colliculus and caudal red nucleus. In Parkinson's disease, the percentages of neurons, from the medial to the lateral part of the substantia nigra, were reduced to 49%, 31%, 41%, and 25% of the control values. The number of neurons in the lateral part showed a negative correlation with the severity of rigidity and hypokinesia, whereas tremor was less noticeable in patients with few neurons. The degree of dementia of the patients had a significant correlation only with neuronal loss in the medial part of the substantia nigra, suggesting, in view of the topographical organization of the neurons in the substantia nigra, that intact projections to the caudate nucleus and limbic and cortical areas are a prerequisite for normal cognitive functioning and that their dysfunction leads to clinical dementia.",

    "abstract": "A topographical immunocytochemical analysis was performed on the substantia nigra from patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and striatonigral degeneration. Antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, and to calcineurin, a marker for striatonigral projection fibers, were used in this study. There was a marked depletion of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of parkinsonian patients compared with control subjects, the reduction being greater in the lateral portion than in the medial portion (p less than 0.001). Calcineurin immunoreactivity was densely distributed throughout the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease and control subjects. The numbers of dopaminergic neurons and of calcineurin-immunoreactive fibers were markedly reduced in the lateral portion of the substantia nigra in all patients with striatonigral degeneration. Our results suggest that many symptoms of these two diseases may be due to disruption of the functions of the putamen and the lateral portion of the substantia nigra, which have dense reciprocal connections as part of the dopamine-related nigrostriatal loop.",

    "abstract": "Preclinical animal models implicate serotonin neurons in the pathophysiology of levodopa (l-dopa)-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease (PD), but effective treatment remains elusive. We examined the relationship between serotonin and l-dopa-induced dyskinesias in a pathologically confirmed cohort of PD patients. We obtained brain tissue from 44 PD cases and 17 age-matched controls and assessed monoamine levels and the serotonin and dopamine transporters in the striatum, and the extent of dopaminergic and serotonergic cell preservation in the substantia nigra (SN) and the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN), respectively. As expected, PD patients demonstrated a severe loss of all dopaminergic markers, including dopamine (P < 0.0001) and the dopamine transporter (P < 0.0001) in the striatum, and dopaminergic neurons (P < 0.001) in the SN, compared with controls. Marked serotonin loss was observed in the caudate (but not putamen) in PD patients compared with controls (P < 0.001), but no difference was found in the levels of the serotonin transporter in the striatum or density of serotonergic neurons in the DRN between these groups, suggesting a functional but not structural change in the serotonergic system in PD. No difference was seen in levels of serotonergic and dopaminergic markers in the striatum between PD patients with and without dyskinesias, or between cases separated according to the clinical severity of their dyskinesias. The absence of a correlation between striatal serotonin markers and the incidence and severity of l-dopa-induced dyskinesias suggests that an intact and functioning serotonergic system is not a risk factor for developing dyskinesias in PD.",

    "abstract": "The present study provides qualitative and quantitative investigations of the norepinephrine (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) in two neurodegenerative disorders, the senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The group of PD subjects was subdivided into cases without dementia (P - D), cases with dementia, L-dopa responsive (P + D), and cases with fulminant dementia whose motor disorder symptoms were L-dopa nonresponsive (P + D/L-dopa non-responsive). NE neurons were demonstrated by immunocytochemistry against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Quantitations of neuronal parameters and cell numbers and three-dimensional reconstructions of the LC were carried out with a computer-assisted system. In SDAT cases, the rostrocaudal LC length (13 +/- 2.2 mm) is shorter than in controls (14.9 +/- 1.4 mm). The four basic LC neuron classes found in the normal human brain (large multipolar, large \"bipolar,\" small multipolar, and small \"bipolar\" neurons; Chan-Palay and Asan: J. Comp. Neurol. this issue) are recognizable, but many cell somata are swollen and misshapen with fore-shortened, thick, and less branched dendrites. LC neuron numbers are reduced (between -3.5% and -87.5%). Neuron loss is greatest in the rostral part, less in the middle, and least in the caudal part. In PD cases, the rostrocaudal length (12.4 +/- 1.5 mm) is shorter than in SDAT and controls. The neuronal morphology is more severely altered than in SDAT. The basic neuron classes are hardly distinguishable. Most cell bodies are swollen; they frequently contain Lewy bodies; and the dendrites are short and thin with absent or reduced arborizations. Neuron numbers are more reduced than in SDAT (between -26.4% and -94.4%). Alterations are as severe caudally as rostrally in P - D, and P + D/L-dopa nonresponsive cases. P + D cases are more severely affected rostrally. The presence of depression in SDAT and Parkinson's patients is accompanied by the greatest loss of LC neurons. On the basis of morphological alterations of the TH-immunoreactive neurons, and the degree and topographical distribution of neuron loss, a differentiation is possible between the LC in normal brain and that in SDAT and PD for diagnostic purposes.",

    "abstract": "From a neuropathological point, the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is confirmed by a neuronal cell loss and the presence of Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra. In Parkinson's disease, the precise type of nigral neuron which degenerate still remains unknown. Are all types of neuron similarly injured, are only subpopulations of neurons vulnerable? In an attempt to answer the question, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the distribution of dopaminergic cells, as identified by immunohistochemistry with a specific antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase, was performed in the ventral mesencephalon of control subjects and patients who died with a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In control brains, two types of catecholaminergic neurons were evidenced; some contain visible-neuromelanin, others do not. In patients with Parkinson's disease, the tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells which contained the pigment were the most vulnerable.",

Four areas of the right SN were investigated at the level of the caudal red nucleus. In AD the number of neurons were reduced to 97%, 79%, 83% and 78% of the control values from the medial to lateral SN respectively. The number of lateral neurons showed a negative correlation with the severity of rigidity and hypokinesia. The degree of dementia did not have a significant correlation with nigral neuronal counts. In PD, the number of neurons was markedly reduced in all parts of the SN, most pronouncedly in the lateral part. The number of lateral neurons showed a negative correlation with the severity of rigidity and hypokinesia, whereas tremor had a positive correlation. The degree of dementia of the patients had a negative correlation with the number of medial neurons, suggesting that degeneration of the nigrostriatal neurons may contribute as a subcortical component to dementia in PD patients.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor Pax6 is a well-accepted neurogenic determinant during development, in adult neural progenitor cells and in acute brain injury models. In the adult brain Pax6 is expressed in selective populations of dopaminergic neurons, and thus may have a role to play in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study looked at post-mortem tissue from patients with PD and in particular the substantia nigra which showed a reduced number of PAX6+ cells compared to age and sex matched control tissue. In an animal model of PD, there was an early transient increase in the number of SN Pax6+ cells at the time of cell loss through apoptosis. Finally we showed that an over-expression of Pax6 in SH-SY5Y cells treated with PD relevant neurotoxins, resulted in an increase in cell survival and a reduction in markers of apoptosis and oxidative stress. These results suggest that Pax6 may have a role to play in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. ",

    "abstract": "A pathological study of 21 patients with Parkinson's disease of asymmetrical onset revealed significant asymmetry of degeneration of the substantia nigra with greater neuronal loss contralateral to the initially affected body side. It has previously been suggested that decline in duration of effectiveness of levodopa doses in Parkinsonian patients with motor oscillations is caused by loss of nigro-striatal dopaminergic terminals with consequent reduction in striatal dopamine storage capacity. If this is true, duration of levodopa motor response should be shorter on the more severely affected body side in patients with asymmetrical disease, as loss of contralateral striatal dopamine storage capacity should be greater. Serial motor evaluations in 20 patients with asymmetrical Parkinson's disease failed to reveal any such asymmetry of duration of motor response to levodopa. It is suggested that striatal dopamine storage is not an important determinant of duration of clinical response to levodopa doses.",

    "abstract": "To examine the natural history and pathogenesis of parkinsonism in Alzheimer's disease, 44 subjects with clearly established senile dementia of the Alzheimer type were studied during a 66-month period. Sixteen subjects (36%) developed idiopathic parkinsonism, and 12 subjects (27%) developed drug-induced parkinsonism; the chief clinical features of both types were bradykinesia and rigidity, but not resting tremor. The presence of parkinsonism was associated with global (rather than selective) cognitive impairment, as determined by psychometric testing, and with more rapid progression to advanced stages of dementia. The pathological correlates of clinical parkinsonism were heterogeneous in 10 subjects with Alzheimer's disease who were examined post mortem. Coexistent Parkinson's disease was observed in five cases and nonspecific nigral degenerative lesions were present in another three; however, two cases had neither histological changes nor reduced neuronal densities in the substantia nigra. These two cases suggested that extranigral lesions, possibly involving mesocortical dopaminergic pathways, may contribute to the development of parkinsonism in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.",

    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients frequently experience well formed recurrent complex visual hallucinations (RCVH). This is associated with reduced blood flow or hypometabolism on imaging of the primary visual cortex. To understand these associations in DLB we used pathological and biochemical analysis of the primary visual cortex to identify changes that could underpin RCVH. Alpha-synuclein or neurofibrillary tangle pathology in primary visual cortex was essentially absent. Neurone density or volume within the primary visual cortex in DLB was also unchanged using unbiased stereology. Microarray analysis, however, demonstrated changes in neuropeptide gene expression and other markers, indicating altered GABAergic neuronal function. Calcium binding protein and GAD65/67 immunohistochemistry showed preserved interneurone populations indicating possible interneurone dysfunction. This was demonstrated by loss of post synaptic GABA receptor markers including gephyrin, GABARAP, and Kif5A, indicating reduced GABAergic synaptic activity. Glutamatergic neuronal signalling was also altered with vesicular glutamate transporter protein and PSD-95 expression being reduced. Changes to the primary visual cortex in DLB indicate that reduced GABAergic transmission may contribute to RCVH in DLB and treatment using targeted GABAergic modulation or similar approaches using glutamatergic modification may be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) was studied morphometrically in three Guamanians with parkinsonism-dementia (PD) and in two Guamanian and two non-Guamanian controls. Paraffin-embedded blocks of the nbM were serially sectioned (20 microns thick) at increments of 200 microns so that a total of 24 sections (eight each from the anterior, intermediate and posterior sectors of the nbM) were studied. The mean cell density was determined for each sector and the diameter of 50 neurons, randomly chosen in the region of apparent maximal density, was calculated. A decrease of the mean cell density, due to the loss of neurons with diameters larger than 20 microns, was found in the PD cases compared to the controls. Two PD patients exhibited striking neuronal loss (65-95%) with predominant involvement of the intermediate and posterior sectors, while the third case showed only minimal neuronal loss in these sectors (15-40%). In both Guamanian and non-Guamanian controls large neurons (diameters greater than or equal to 20 microns) exceeded small neurons while the reverse was true in all sectors of the nbM for the PD cases. These data, while confirming a previous study reporting neuronal loss in the nbM of PD patients, underline the importance of detailed morphometric analysis of the different sectors of the nbM to recognize those patients in whom lesions are not uniformly distributed.",

    "abstract": "Computer visualization techniques were used to map the distribution of dopaminergic neurons within midbrain tissue sections from 5 parkinsonian patients and 3 age-matched control subjects. The Parkinsonian brains had over 50% fewer dopaminergic neurons within the midbrain than age-matched normal brains. The cell loss occurred within the combined substantia nigra (dopaminergic nucleus A9) and retrorubral (dopaminergic nucleus A8) areas (greater than 61%) and the ventral tegmental area (dopaminergic nucleus A10) (greater than 42%). The cell loss was greatest within the ventral portion of the substantia nigra zona compacta. The specific pattern of cell loss is very similar to the pattern of cells that project to the striatum (as opposed to cortical and limbic sites) in animal neuroanatomical tracing experiments. These data suggest that Parkinson's disease preferentially destroys midbrain dopaminergic neurons in nuclei A8, A9, and A10, which project to the striatum.",

The pathologic changes that contribute to visual hallucinations are not known, but several hypotheses implicate deficient attentional processing. The superior colliculus has a role in visual attention and planning eye movements and has been directly implicated in several models of visual hallucinations. Therefore, the present study sought to identify neurodegenerative changes that may contribute to hallucinations in DLB.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is associated with nearly all the cases of Parkinson's disease (PD) and typically manifests years before motor symptoms are detected. The cellular mechanisms underlying this dysfunction, however, are not understood. In this study, olfactory bulbs (OBs) from male control and PD subjects were examined by histology for changes in cytoarchitecture. These studies found that the general OB laminar organization and the number of interneurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase were unaltered. In contrast, the number of mitral/tufted projection neurons and interneurons expressing Calretinin were significantly decreased in PD subjects. This study reveals changes in OB cytoarchitecture mediated by PD and provides valuable insight into identifying specific OB neuronal populations vulnerable to PD-related neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "In idiopathic Parkinson's disease massive cell death occurs in the dopamine-containing substantia nigra. A link between the vulnerability of nigral neurons and the prominent pigmentation of the substantia nigra, though long suspected, has not been proved. This possibility is supported by evidence that N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and its metabolite MPP+, the latter of which causes destruction of nigral neurons, bind to neuromelanin. We have directly tested this hypothesis by a quantitative analysis of neuromelanin-pigmented neurons in control and parkinsonian midbrains. The findings demonstrate first that the dopamine-containing cell groups of the normal human midbrain differ markedly from each other in the percentage of neuromelanin-pigmented neurons they contain. Second, the estimated cell loss in these cell groups in Parkinson's disease is directly correlated (r = 0.97, P = 0.0057) with the percentage of neuromelanin-pigmented neurons normally present in them. Third, within each cell group in the Parkinson's brains, there is greater relative sparing of non-pigmented than of neuromelanin-pigmented neurons. This evidence suggests a selective vulnerability of the neuromelanin-pigmented subpopulation of dopamine-containing mesencephalic neurons in Parkinson's disease.",

We have examined two autopsy cases with Huntington's disease (HD), three cases with Parkinson's disease, and two senile patients as controls. In the controls, calcineurin immunoreactivity was present in neuronal cells only and highly concentrated in the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus (striato-pallidal pathway), substantia nigra (striato-nigral pathway) and hippocampal formation. These localizations were similar to those identified in rat brain. There was a marked depletion of neurons containing calcineurin in the caudate nucleus and putamen, and a marked reduction of calcineurin-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra were found in the cases with HD, but not in those with Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that calcineurin can be a useful and specific index of neuronal degeneration in the caudato-putamen resulting from extrapyramidal disease, and that the calcineurin-immunostaining method can be a valuable tool for clarifying the anatomy of the human extrapyramidal system.",

    "abstract": "The α-synuclein protein, encoded by SNCA, has a key role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Although usually sporadic, Parkinson's disease can result from inherited copy number variants in SNCA and other genes. We have hypothesized a role of somatic SNCA mutations, leading to mosaicism, in sporadic synucleinopathies. The evidence for mosaicism in healthy and diseased brain is increasing rapidly, with somatic copy number gains of APP reported in Alzheimer's brain. Here we demonstrate somatic SNCA copy number gains in synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy), focusing on substantia nigra. We selected sporadic cases with relatively young onset or short disease duration, and first excluded high level copy number variant mosaicism by DNA analysis using digital PCR for SNCA, and/or customized array comparative genomic hybridization. To detect low level SNCA copy number variant mosaicism, we used fluorescent in situ hybridization with oligonucleotide custom-designed probes for SNCA, validated on brain and fibroblasts with known copy number variants. We determined SNCA copy number in nigral dopaminergic neurons and other cells in frozen nigra sections from 40 cases with Parkinson's disease and five with multiple system atrophy, and 25 controls, in a blinded fashion. Parkinson's disease cases were significantly more likely than controls to have any SNCA gains in dopaminergic neurons (P = 0.0036), and overall (P = 0.0052). The average proportion of dopaminergic neurons with gains in each nigra was significantly higher in Parkinson's disease than controls (0.78% versus 0.45%; P = 0.017). There was a negative correlation between the proportion of dopaminergic neurons with gains and onset age in Parkinson's disease (P = 0.013), but not with disease duration, or age of death in cases or controls. Cases with tremor at onset were less likely to have gains (P = 0.035). All multiple system atrophy cases had gains, and the highest levels in dopaminergic neurons were in two of these cases (2.76%, 2.48%). We performed selective validation with different probes after dye swapping. All three control probes used showed minimal or no gains (≤0.1% in dopaminergic neurons). We also found occasional SNCA gains in frontal neurons of cases with Parkinson's disease, and the putamen of one multiple system atrophy case. We present evidence of somatic SNCA gains in brain, more commonly in nigral dopaminergic neurons of Parkinson's disease than controls, negatively correlated with onset age, and possibly commonest in some multiple system atrophy cases. Somatic SNCA gains may be a risk factor for sporadic synucleinopathies, or a result of the disease process.10.1093/brain/awy157_video1awy157media15813519976001.",

In the Parkinsonian cases, the rostral part of the nucleus of Edinger Westphal disclosed Lewy bodies in 3% of the neurons, neurofibrillary degeneration in 2% of the neurons, and a 54% neuronal loss. In Alzheimer's disease, 2% of Edinger Westphal neurons contained neurofibrillary degeneration, whereas in senile dementia of Alzheimer's type only rare neurofibrillary degeneration was evident in this nucleus. Neuronal loss was not apparent in the nucleus of Edinger Westphal in either of the Alzheimer's cases. The pathologic changes observed in this presumably cholinergic nucleus resemble in some respects changes reported in the cholinergic centers of the basal forebrain in these diseases. In addition, the central gray matter and pretectal region in Parkinson's disease contained a patchy increase in astroglia, some with scant reactive cell bodies; however, Lewy bodies were limited to that part of the central gray matter corresponding to the nucleus of Darkschewitsch. A few neurofibrillary tangles were present in the nucleus of Darkschewitsch in both diseases.",

The melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells are involved in the control and regulation of these processes and may be affected in PD, as other retinal and visual implications have been described in the disease. Number and morphology of human melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in eyes from donors with PD or control. The Sholl number of intersections, the number of branches, and the number of terminals from the Sholl analysis were significantly reduced in PD melanopsin ganglion cells. Also, the density of these cells significantly decreased in PD compared to controls. Degeneration and impairment of the retinal melanopsin system may affect to sleep and circadian dysfunction reported in PD pathology, and its protection or stimulation may lead to better disease prospect and global quality of life of patients.",

    "abstract": "The underlying biology of essential tremor (ET) is poorly understood. Purkinje cell (PC) loss has been observed in some studies, although this finding remains somewhat controversial. Basket cells are interneurons whose axonal collaterals form a plexus around PC soma. When there is PC loss, this basket plexus appears empty. We used dual immunohistochemical staining for calbindin D28k and glutamic acid decarboxylase to quantify \"empty baskets\" as an indirect and alternative method of detecting PC loss. Microscopic analyses on 127 brains included ET and a spectrum of motor neurodegenerative diseases (50 ET, 27 spinocerebellar ataxias [SCAs], 25 Parkinson disease, 25 controls). The median percentage of empty baskets in ET patients was 1.5 times higher than controls (48.8% vs 33.5%, p < 0.001) but lower in ET than in SCA1 (59.7%, p = 0.011), SCA2 (77.5%, p = 0.003), and SCA6 (87.0%, p < 0.001). PC loss is not a feature of SCA3, and the median percentage of empty baskets (30.1%) was similar to controls (p = 0.303). These data provide support for PC loss in ET and are consistent with the notion that ET could represent a mild form of cerebellar degeneration with an intermediate degree of PC loss.",

    "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are synucleinopathies characterized by aggregation of α-synuclein in brain cells. Recent studies have shown that morphological changes in terms of cerebral nerve cell loss and increase in glia cell numbers, the degree of brain atrophy and molecular and epidemiological findings are more severe in MSA than PD. In the present study, we performed a stereological comparison of cerebellar volumes, granule and Purkinje cells in 13 patients diagnosed with MSA [8 MSA-P (striatonigral subtype) and 5 MSA-C (olivopontocerebellar subtype)], 12 PD patients, and 15 age-matched control subjects. Only brains from MSA-C patients showed a reduction in the total number of Purkinje cells (anterior lobe) whereas both MSA-P and MSA-C patients had reduced Purkinje cell volumes (perikaryons and nuclei volume). The cerebellum of both diseases showed a reduction in the white matter volume compared to controls. The number of granule cells was unaffected in both diseases. Analyses of cell type-specific mRNA expression supported our structural data. This study of the cerebellum is in line with previous findings in the cerebrum and demonstrates that the degree of morphological changes is more pronounced in MSA-C than MSA-P and PD. Further, our results support an explicit involvement of cerebellar Purkinje cells and white matter connectivity in MSA-C > MSA-P and points to the potential importance of white matter alterations in PD pathology.",

    "abstract": "Hyposmia is prodromal, and male sex is a risk marker for an enhanced likelihood ratio of Parkinson's disease. The literature regarding olfactory bulb volume reduction is controversial, although the olfactory bulb has been largely reported as an early and preferential site for α-synucleinopathy. These pathological deposits have been correlated with neural loss in Nissl-stained material. However, microgliosis has rarely been studied, and astrogliosis has been virtually neglected. In the present report, α-synucleinopathy (α-synuclein), neurodegeneration (Neu-N), astrogliosis (GFAP), and microgliosis (Iba-1) were quantified, using specific markers and stereological methods. Disease, sex, age, disease duration, and post-mortem interval were considered variables for statistical analysis. No volumetric changes have been identified regarding disease or sex. α-Synucleinopathy was present throughout the OB, mainly concentrated on anterior olfactory nucleus. Neurodegeneration (reduction in Neu-N-positive cells) was statistically significant in the diseased group. Astrogliosis (increased GFAP labeling) and microgliosis (increased Iba-1 labeling) were significantly enhanced in the Parkinson's disease group. When analyzed per sex, neurodegeneration and microgliosis differences are only present in men. These data constitute the demonstration of sex differences in neurodegeneration using specific neural markers, enhanced astrogliosis and increased microgliosis, also linked to male sex, in the human olfactory bulb in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The failure of glial cell derived neurotropic factor to be efficacious in blinded clinical trials for Parkinson's disease may be due to alterations in signaling receptors and downstream signaling molecules. To test this hypothesis, brain sections were obtained from older adults with no motor deficit (n = 6), minimal motor deficits (n = 10), and clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (n = 10) who underwent motor examination proximate to death. Quantitative unbiased stereology and densitometry were performed to analyze RET and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 expression in nigral neurons. Individuals with no motor deficit had extensive and intense RET and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 immunoreactive neurons in substantia nigra. The number and staining intensity of RET-immunoreactive neurons were reduced moderately in subjects with minimal motor deficits and severely reduced in Parkinson's disease relative to no motor deficit group. The number and staining intensity of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 was more markedly reduced in both subjects with minimal motor deficits and Parkinson's disease. Reductions in levels of RET and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 were recapitulated in a non-human primate genetic Parkinson's disease model based on over-expression of human mutant α-synuclein (A53T). These data indicate that for neurotrophic factors to be effective in patients with minimal motor deficits or PD, these factors would likely have to upregulate RET and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 immunoreactive neurons in substantia nigra .",

A morphometric study of this nucleus was performed in two cases of PSP and in a cohort of cases of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT), and age-matched controls. In PSP a significant 60% neuronal loss in PPNc was associated with neurofibrillary tangles in 40 to 64% of the remaining neurons. In Parkinson's disease there was a significant decrease in cell numbers and density by 53 and 51%, respectively, with Lewy bodies involving 6 to 39% of all neurons. In Alzheimer's disease and SDAT, large neurons were reduced by 29 and 33.8%, respectively, with tangles in 9 to 38% of the remaining cells. The selective affection of this putative cholinergic nucleus in PSP and Parkinson's disease appears to be related to motor dysfunctions in these disorders.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disease that is pathologically described as a six-stage α-synucleinopathy. In stage 4, α-synuclein reaches the hippocampus, inducing cognitive deficits, from which it progresses to the isocortex, leading to dementia. Among hippocampal fields, cornu ammonis 2 is particularly affected by this α-synucleinopathy and critical for cognitive decline. Volumetric studies using magnetic resonance imaging have produced controversial results, with only some reporting volume loss, whereas stereological data obtained using nonspecific markers do not reveal volume changes, neural or glial loss. Proteomic analysis has not been carried out in the hippocampus of patients with PD.",

    "abstract": "In the brains of humans and other mammals, there are two principal groups of cholinergic nuclei aside from those forming the cranial motor nuclei. One group lies in the forebrain and includes the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The second group lies in the hindbrain and includes the nucleus tegmenti pedunculopontinus (NPP), identified by Mesulam et al. [Mesulam, M.-M., Mufson, E. J., Wainer, B. H. & Levey, A. I. (1983) Neuroscience 10, 1185-1201] as cholinergic cell group Ch5. The basal forebrain cholinergic cell groups, which innervate widespread areas of the neocortex, undergo degeneration in Alzheimer disease and also in parkinsonism associated with dementia. We here report that the hindbrain NPP Ch5 cell group, thought to innervate many nuclei of the extrapyramidal motor system, the superior colliculus, and the substantia innominata, undergoes degeneration in idiopathic Parkinson disease and in the parkinsonian syndrome of progressive supranuclear palsy. These findings strongly suggest that degeneration in the brainstem in Parkinson disease is not confined to catecholamine-containing neurons, but that cholinergic neurons of the NPP are also vulnerable. The findings further raise the possibility that certain symptoms of Parkinson disease and progressive supranuclear palsy have their genesis in pathology of these cholinergic neurons.",

In PEPS the rate of progression of disease was extremely slow. The groups were of a similar age at death, but the post-encephalitic cases had 70% fewer cells in the substantia nigra than in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and 92% fewer than in controls. Nigral cell destruction was not found in PEPS, but active cell breakdown and abundant extraneuronal melanin were present in PD. A second group of 12 LB-PD cases with mean onset at 58.9 years survived for a mean of 10.1 years, but the number of remaining substantia nigra cells was the same as in the young onset cases of PD. This clinical and pathological evidence does not support the notion that progression of disease in PD can be attributed to the superadded effects of normal ageing on top of a primary acute noxious insult sustained in earlier life.",

    "abstract": "The recent finding of neuronal degeneration in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) in Alzheimer's disease suggests a possible role of this nucleus and the cholinergic system in dementing illness. We assessed neuronal population and density in two anatomical levels of the nbM in 38 coded brains from patients with a broad variety of neurological disorders. We found the most striking nbM degeneration in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. An intermediate loss of neurons was noted in the transmissible dementia Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and in progressive supranuclear palsy. The usually nondementing diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis showed cell counts comparable to those in a control group of nondemented patients with cerebrovascular disease. Characteristic neuropathological changes of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases, progressive supranuclear palsy, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis were also found in the nbM. Most previous studies of the nbM have been based on small numbers of cases compared with controls. In our large series we used consistent methodology and a multiple-comparison statistical procedure to avoid overreporting of statistical significance. Our comparison of the nbM not only confirms the marked degeneration of the nbM in Alzheimer's disease, but also places such degeneration into perspective in a spectrum of dementing and nondementing neurological diseases. Larger case studies, using appropriate statistical techniques for multiple group comparisons, are needed to establish the significance of nbM degeneration in neurological disease.",

    "abstract": "Dementia in Parkinson's disease has previously been attributed to the presence in the cerebral cortex of Alzheimer-type neuropathological abnormalities. New evidence suggests, however, that dementia in this disease usually occurs in the absence of substantial Alzheimer-type changes in the cortex and may be related to abnormalities in the cortical cholinergic system. Thus, in Parkinsonian patients with dementia there were extensive reductions of choline acetyltransferase and less extensive reductions of acetylcholinesterase in all four cortical lobes. Choline acetyltransferase reductions in temporal neocortex correlated with the degree of mental impairment assessed by a test of memory and information but not with the extent of plaque or tangle formation. In Parkinson's but not Alzheimer's disease the decrease in neocortical (particularly temporal) choline acetyltransferase correlated with the number of neurons in the nucleus of Meynert suggesting that primary degeneration of these cholinergic neurons may be related, directly or indirectly, to declining cognitive function in Parkinson's disease.",

Because neurochemical evidence suggested that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) may also be involved, the present study was designed to evaluate the mesolimbic dopamine system in PD by counting pigmented neurons in the VTA contralateral to therapeutic lesions placed in the basal ganglia or thalamus. In PD, VTA neurons were depleted to 36 to 55% of control values. Moreover, the VTA showed excessive free pigment, a marker for death of pigmented neurons. These changes may be important in disorders of movement or mentation occurring in PD.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal loss was estimated semiquantitatively in the substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC), and by cell counts in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM), in 32 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (14 non-demented and 18 demented). The number of senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) was rated in four cortical areas. Neuronal loss in the SN seemed in dependent of mental impairment, while severe lesions of the LC were more frequent in demented patients. In the NBM, neuronal loss and Lewy bodies were observed in most cases (95%) and were associated with significant reductions of choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity both in the NBM and the cortex (measurements available for 13 cases). This confirms that the cholinergic innominato-cortical pathway is damaged in Parkinson's disease and that the lesion is severer in subjects with dementia. SP and NFT were present in the cortex in 75% of the cases and significantly more numerous in demented patients. However, in 37% of the cases (six cases with dementia), the score for cortical changes was low and could be related to age. Cortical SP and NFT were not correlated to the degree of cell loss in LC and NBM, or to CAT activity in the cortex or NBM. Damage to coeruleo-cortical, innominato-cortical and intra-cortical neurones could each play a role in the appearance of dementia in Parkinsonism. The lesions in the different neuronal systems do not seem to evolve in parallel, but may be additive or potentiate one another in terms of functional expression. Also, the variety in extent and degree of lesions encountered in Parkinson's disease may offer a pathological substrate for the wide variety of mental symptoms described in this illness.",

Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and senile dementia were among the diseases studied. Nerve cell loss, the appearance of neurofibrillary changes and Lewy bodies were examined semi-quantitatively. The number of nerve cells diminished in old age, especially over 90 years. The decrease of nerve cells was greater in cases with Lewy bodies. A marked loss of nerve cell was observed in multiple system atrophies, including Shy-Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar atrophy and striatonigral degeneration, and in some cases of Parkinson's disease and senile dementia. The number of nerve cells did not decrease in cases of progressive supranuclear palsy. Lewy bodies and neurofibrillary tangles appeared increasingly in old age. However, the incidence of both changes in the same neuron was rare, and in such cases their structures appeared not to be related.",

It was found that all cases of autonomic failure had suffered severe cell loss; on average three quarters of their lateral horn cells were lost.

    "abstract": "The basal nucleus of Meynert (bnM) was examined in 6 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and in 5 age-matched controls. The histopathological study was followed by a quantitative analysis of the magnocellular population of the nucleus, with the determination of the number of neurons and their nucleolar volume. In Parkinson's disease, there was a neuronal loss ranging from 29.9% to 68.3% (mean 45.8%) and numerous surviving cells containing Lewy inclusion bodies. The percentage loss of cells did not display a significant correlation with the age of the patients, the duration of the illness, the mental state or the drug regime. On the other hand, no significant differences in nucleolar volume of bnM neurons were detected between patients and controls. The damage of the basal nucleus of Meynert in Parkinson's disease is less severe than that generally observed in Alzheimer's disease, and is slightly more pronounced than that reported for progressive supranuclear palsy.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus basalis of Meynert, the major source of cholinergic innervation of the cerebral cortex, was morphometrically investigated in 58 cases of neuropsychiatric disorders and compared to 14 controls. The results demonstrate a loss of neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert in Alzheimer's disease (70%), paralysis agitans (77%), and Korsakoff's disease (47%) but no marked reduction of neurons in postencephalitic parkinsonism, Huntington's disease, chronic alcoholism without dementia, schizophrenia and infantile brain damage. Neurons of the three subdivisions of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (the nucleus septi medialis, the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca and the nucleus basalis Meynert neurons in the substantia innominata) may be affected in a different manner in different patients within a single group homogeneous with respect to the usual clinical and neuropathological diagnostic criteria. Cell loss in the basal forebrain is restricted to the large neurons of the nucleus basalis, the immediately adjacent neurons of the globus pallidus externus not being affected. The selective degeneration of these neurons provides the morphological correlate of the cortical cholinergic deficiency in these neuropathological conditions. The degeneration of this discrete cholinergic neuronal population in several disorders of higher cortical function is probably directly related to the progressive deterioration of memory and cognitive processes in affected patients.",

    "abstract": "The numbers of nerve cells in the substantia nigra and locus caeruleus were counted, and the volume of their nucleolus and the amount of neuromelanin pigment they contain measured, in patients with Parkinson's disease and in age-matched and elderly individuals free from neurological illness. The number of pigmented nerve cells of both types is reduced by about 20% in the elderly when compared with age-matched controls. The melanin content of the remaining cells in the elderly is lessened (by 11% in substantia nigra and 21% in locus caeruleus) in such a way as to indicate that this age depletion in cell number results from a preferential loss of those nerve cells which contain the greatest amounts of melanin pigment. In Parkinson's disease there is a greater overall reduction in the amount of melanin within remaining cells (15% in substantia nigra, 25% in locus caeruleus) because of a more severe (80%) loss of the heavier pigmented cells. The basis for Parkinson's disease may therefore lie with an aggravation, possibly by secondary factors, of changes that occur within neurones of substantia nigra and locus caeruleus as part of their \"normal\" process of ageing.",

    "abstract": "In order to investigate the correlation between single section (SS) and disector (DS) counts for estimating the pigmented neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNpc), 12 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and seven controls were studied. The SS counts were obtained at the level of the exit of the third cranial nerve in the SNpc. The DS counts were made from the whole volume of the SNpc. There was a significant correlation between SS and DS counts (r = 0.94, P < 0.001), suggesting that the methods closely agree. Comparison of SS and DS counts in controls and PD patients showed that the pigmented neurons in PD were decreased by 75% (P < 0.001) and 55% (P < 0.001) in the SS and DS counts, respectively. This study suggests that loss of pigmented neurons from the SNpc in PD can be estimated by either method.",

Concerning Parkinson's disease (PD) it remains to be elucidated, if NO contributes to pathological alterations in the striatum. The present study evaluates the post-mortem putamen of PD patients and control subjects for distribution patterns of NO-synthase containing neurons, using the NADPH-diaphorase technique. The ratio of positively stained neurons and the total number of cells (control: 1,120 +/- 69 per mm2, n = 5; PD: 575 +/- 164mm2, n = 5) shows striking differences between controls and PD patients.

    "abstract": "High-affinity nicotine binding, considered to primarily reflect the presence of CNS alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptor subunits, was examined autoradiographically in brain regions most severely affected by Alzheimer and Parkinson types of pathology. In the midbrain, the high density of binding associated with the pars compacta of the substantia nigra was extensively reduced (65-75%, particularly in the lateral portion) in both Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease. Since loss of dopaminergic neurons in Lewy body dementia was only moderate (40%), loss or down-regulation of the nicotinic receptor may precede degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in this region. In the dorsolateral tegmentum, where diffuse cholinergic perikarya are located, nicotine binding was highly significantly decreased in both Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease with almost no overlap between the normal and disease groups, indicative of a major pathological involvement in or around the pedunculopontine cholinergic neurons. In the hippocampus, binding was decreased around the granular layer in Lewy body dementia and Alzheimer's disease, although unchanged in the stratum lacunosum moleculare, where binding was relatively higher. Dense bands of receptor binding in the presubiculum and parahippocampal gyrus--areas of highest binding in human cortex--were diminished in Alzheimer's disease but not Lewy body dementia. In temporal neocortex there were reductions in Alzheimer's disease throughout the cortical layers but in Lewy body dementia only in lower layers, in which Lewy bodies are concentrated. Abnormalities of the nicotinic receptor in the diseases examined appear to be closely associated with primary histopathological changes: dopaminergic cell loss in Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia, amyloid plaques and tangles in subicular and entorhinal areas in Alzheimer's disease. Loss or down-regulation of the receptor may precede neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by a heterogeneous loss of dopaminergic neurons in the human mesencephalon affecting mainly the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and to a lesser extent the other dopaminergic cell groups. A rise in intracellular calcium concentrations represents one of the final events leading to nerve cell death. Calbindin D28k, a protein capable of buffering intracellular calcium concentrations is present in the dopaminergic neurons that are selectively preserved in PD but not in those that degenerate. To determine whether other calcium-binding proteins also represent putative protective factors of dopaminergic neurons in PD, we analyzed immunohistochemically the distribution of calretinin-containing (CR+) neurons, in the human mesencephalon of three control subjects and four patients with PD. No significant differences were observed between the number of CR+ neurons in the two subject groups. Sequential double immunostaining for calretinin and tyrosine hydroxylase showed a variable proportion of CR+ neurons among dopaminergic neurons: moderate co-localization was found in catecholaminergic cell group A8 and in the dorsal part of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and low co-localization in the SNpc, the ventral part of the VTA and the central gray substance. This indicates that calretinin may only protect some dopaminergic neurons against degeneration in PD. Yet, in the SNpc a selective preservation of CR+ dopaminergic neurons was observed, suggesting a neuroprotective role in some dopaminergic cell groups only.",

    "abstract": "The disector (DS) is a method by which it is possible to estimate the density of cells in a volume of tissue, and when associated with Cavalieri's principle, the total number of cells of a neural nucleus. Since the introduction of this method, there has been some uncertainty about the value of cell counts estimated using single section (SS). To compare these two methods, we counted the pigmented neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNpc) in seven normal controls and in four patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), using both single histological sections and the DS. The calculations were performed at two different levels of the substantia nigra. Level I was cut through the colliculus superior and caudal red nucleus, and level II showed the exit of the third cranial nerve in all cases. As methods, the two counts were in close agreement (Pearson's correlation coefficient at levels I and II were r = 0.97 and r = 1.00, respectively, P < 0.001). The correspondence was different in the controls and in the parkinsonian patients, however, as can be judged from the slopes of the average regression lines (0.20 for controls, 0.31 for parkinsonian patients). It is nevertheless evident that once the regression line has been defined. DS counts can be estimated from SS counts when the pigmented neuron numbers are counted in the SNpc. The results suggest that comparisons of pigmented neuron counts made from SS are relevant if the cutting level of the section is well defined, and if section thickness is kept constant.",

This is in marked contrast to the case in Parkinson's disease where only some 12.7 +/- 2.6% of the remaining dopaminergic neurons showed bFGF-like immunoreactivity, providing further evidence against the hypothesis that Parkinson's disease is due to some early insult followed by age-related attrition of the remaining neurons.",

    "abstract": "Several observations suggest that neuronal shrinkage rather than cell death is the major phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases. In order to make this distinction, smaller cells should also be included in cell counts. Also, morphometric determination of total cell numbers of brain structures is required. Morphometry was performed on the locus coeruleus using a newly developed method to delineate this nucleus from five patients who had died with Alzheimer's disease, five with Parkinson's disease, five with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and from five control subjects who had died from causes that would not have affected the locus coeruleus. The length and volume of the locus coeruleus and its total number of large pigmented neurons, small unpigmented neurons and glial cells were determined. Since reliable delineation of the boundaries of the locus coeruleus is a requirement for the determination of total cell numbers, an image analyser-assisted procedure was developed. In Alzheimer's disease we found an 82% decrease in the number of large pigmented neurons and a 39% decrease of small unpigmented neurons. In Parkinson's disease, we found a 39% decrease of large pigmented neurons but also a 44% (though not significant) increase of small unpigmented neurons, which is indicative of a shift from large pigmented neurons to small unpigmented neurons in Parkinson's disease. The large pigmented/small unpigmented neuron number ratio was greatly and significantly reduced in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These findings support the hypothesis that the decrease of large pigmented neurons of the locus coeruleus in some neurodegenerative diseases is not entirely due to cell death, but rather to cell shrinkage and a loss of phenotype. This hypothesis may have consequences for the development of therapeutic strategies since atrophied cells can be activated. On the other hand our data confirm that, at least in Alzheimer's disease, large pigmented neurons do also undergo cell death.",

    "abstract": "We determined the number of immunocytochemically identified oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the human hypothalamus of six Parkinson's disease (PD) patients ranging from 59 to 83 years of age. Six subjects without a primary neurologic or psychiatric disease, ranging from 69 to 88 years of age, served as controls. The OXT-immunoreactive cell number in the PVN of the PD patients was 22% lower than that of the control subjects. Although Lewy bodies were present in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, there were no Lewy bodies in the PVN of these patients. Doubt is raised about the presumed direct relationship between the presence of Lewy bodies and neuronal degeneration in PD. The AVP-immunoreactive cell number in the PD patients showed a similar decreasing trend, but the 18% reduction failed to reach statistical significance. The presence of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the PVN was not affected in PD patients, supporting the notion that dopaminergic neurons of the mesencephalon, but not of the hypothalamus, are affected in PD. The decreased number of OXT-containing neurons in the PVN suggests that dopamine may be important for the function of these neurons and may provide a neural basis for some autonomic and endocrine disturbances in PD.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of neurofilament immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra was examined by immunohistochemistry in five patients dying with Parkinson's disease and six control patients dying without neurological disease. In controls, pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra were intensively labelled by SMI32, a monoclonal antibody to non-phosphorylated neurofilament protein. In the substantia nigra from patients who had Parkinson's disease, there was a pronounced reduction of SMI32 labelling intensity in surviving pigmented neurons. By contrast, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in surviving pigmented neurons was normal. SMI32 labelling was normal in regions of the brainstem not affected by the neuropathological process of Parkinson's disease. Findings with either antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilament, or enzymatic dephosphorylation followed by SMI32 labelling, indicated that loss of SMI32 immunostaining in Parkinson's disease was not due to masking of the neurofilament epitopes by phosphorylation. Our results indicate that neurofilament proteins are particularly likely to be disrupted or destroyed by the neuropathological process of Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, the normal appearance of tyrosine hydroxylase indicates that protein synthesising systems may be intact in surviving neurons. Loss of neurofilament immunoreactivity may prove a sensitive neuropathological marker for characterisation of degenerating neurons in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "The neostriatum, nucleus accumbens and basal nucleus of Meynert (bnM) in the parkinsonism-dementia complex of Guam (Guam PDC) were examined immunohistologically, ultrastructurally, quantitatively and topographically, and the results were compared with those in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Compared to neurologically normal controls, the number of large neurons in Guam PDC was reduced by approximately 70% in the caudate nucleus and putamen and by more than 90% in the nucleus accumbens. The decreased number of large neurons in the neostriatum was significantly correlated to that in the bnM. The remaining large neurons and many of the medium-sized neurons in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens were immunopositive for tau protein and contained varying amounts of 21- to 25-nm-wide paired helical filaments (PHFs) admixed with straight tubules. Curly fibers and circularly arranged reactive astrocytes were seen in the nucleus accumbens of many PDC patients. Collectively, these findings, which are similar in part to those of AD and differ from those of PSP, suggest that the large neurons in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens in Guam PDC degenerate through PHF formation, and that extremely severe loss of large neurons in the nucleus accumbens may be linked to marked degeneration of the limbic and ventral tegmental areas and nucleus dorsal raphe.",

We report that NADPH-d-containing neurons within the striatum are spared in patients with Parkinson's (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a number of these neurons in both diseases appeared shrunken or bulbous with foreshortened dendritic processes. Quantitative analysis of cell areas revealed a significant difference only in the size of putamenal AD neurons which were decreased compared to normal controls.

We counted neurons, Lewy bodies, diffuse and neuritic senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads in the frontal and medial temporal cortex and hippocampus from 5 autopsied cases of Lewy body disease (without AD histopathology), 7 with combined Lewy body disease and AD, 6 with AD, and 5 age-matched normal control subjects. Average neuronal counts in the cases with Lewy body disease were indistinguishable from those of control subjects, but higher than those for AD and combined Lewy body disease and AD. Diffuse plaque densities were similar in all disease forms. Neuritic senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuropil threads were numerous in AD and combined Lewy body disease and AD, but sparse or absent in Lewy body disease and controls. Pure Lewy body disease and AD appear to be distinct clinicopathological entities except for the common feature of diffuse plaques in both disorders.",

    "abstract": "In this study, calbindin D-28k (CaBP), monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFr) immunoreactivities were investigated in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) in patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), with Parkinson's disease (PD) with or without dementia, and in controls. Immunocytochemistry using specific antibodies in differing serial sections was employed, and cell counts and NbM nuclear volume measurements were made. Most of the large multipolar NbM neurons showed CaBP immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of their somata, dendrites and axons. In adjacent, NGFr-reacted sections, the large NbM neurons were also found to be intensely immunoreactive for NGFr on their cellular surfaces. In addition, a subpopulation of large NbM neurons and glial cells were found to be immunoreactive for MAO A. The number of CaBP-immunoreactive (CaBP-i) neurons was decreased by an average of 55% in the 6 SDAT patients, 70% in the 2 nondemented PD patients and 40% in the 1 demented PD patient. The volume calculated for the compact part of the NbM formed by the CaBP-i neuronal somata decreased by an average of 47% in SDAT. On the other hand, measurements in the volume of NGFr-i neurons (including the dendritic arborization) showed an average decrease of 25% in SDAT patients compared to controls. Although all SDAT and PD patients showed a decrease of CaBP-i neurons in the NbM, a loss of MAO-A-i NbM neurons was found only in those patients with dementia. Therefore, the relative proportions of MAO-A-i to CaBP-i neurons were increased in the nondemented PD patients (14.2 and 19.6%) when compared with those in the demented PD patient (2.2%) and with the SDAT patients (0.3-5.6%). These data indicate that a balanced presence of MAO-A-i cholinergic, large NbM neurons may be necessary for the proper maintenance of cognitive function. Functionally this may be translated to mean that dementing changes may cause a decrease from the normal amount of MAO A enzyme activity. This suggests that therapeutic strategies based upon correction of MAO-A activities by MAO-A inhibitors may be important to ameliorating some of the loss in cholinergic function in dementias of SDAT and PD.",

    "abstract": "Hyperoxidation phenomena are suspected to be involved in dopaminergic cell death in Parkinson's disease, which affects preferentially the neuromelanin-containing dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Glutathione peroxidase is the major protective enzyme against hydrogen peroxide toxicity. The distribution of glutathione peroxidase-containing cells was investigated by immunohistochemistry in the midbrain of four control subjects and four patients with Parkinson's disease. (1) Glutathione peroxidase-like immunoreactivity was detected exclusively in glial cells. (2) In control brains, the density of glutathione peroxidase-positive cells was higher in the vicinity of the dopaminergic cell groups known to be resistant to the pathological process of Parkinson's disease. (3) In Parkinson's disease, an increased density of glutathione peroxidase-immunostained cells was observed, surrounding the surviving dopaminergic neurons. The increase in glutathione peroxidase-containing cells was correlated with the severity in dopaminergic cell loss in the respective cell groups. The data suggest that in control brains, a low density of glutathione peroxidase-positive cells surround the dopaminergic neurons the most vulnerable to Parkinson's disease, and that in parkinsonian brains, the increased number of glutathione peroxidase-positive cells may contribute to protect neurons against pathological death. Thus, the amount of glutathione peroxidase protein-containing cells may be critical for a protective effect against oxidative stress, although it cannot be excluded that the level of the enzyme activity remains the crucial factor.",

The mean number of melanin-positive neurons in sections of PD SN was 30.3% of the control mean, but the number of bFGF-immunopositive neurons was only 4.7% of the control mean. bFGF-immunoreactivity was present in only 8.2% of PD, but in 93.7% of control melanin-positive neurons.

    "abstract": "We used immunohistochemical analysis to determine whether medulla oblongata neurons containing phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) are affected in patients who died with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n = 7) compared with age-matched control subjects who died with nonneurological diseases (n = 8). Transverse sections (50 microns) of medulla were prepared either for conventional neuropathological examination or for the immunohistochemical demonstration of PNMT. Immunopositive neurons at approximately 30 rostrocaudal levels, evenly spaced throughout the whole medulla, were mapped and cells in each section were counted with a camera lucida system linked to a computer. In the ventrolateral medulla, from the level of the obex to 11 mm rostral to the obex where the C1 group of neurons is located, there were 7,631 +/- 844 PNMT-positive neurons in control brains and 3,604 +/- 1,051 in brains affected by Parkinson's disease (47% of control). Many PNMT-positive neurons contained Lewy bodies. We observed a previously undescribed midline (C3) group of PNMT-positive neurons in normal brains, and this group was also severely affected (12% of control) in parkinsonian brains. Neither the C2 group nor the small PNMT-positive neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarii were significantly reduced in numbers but there was a reduction in the numbers of melanin-pigmented cells in both the ventrolateral (50% of control) and the dorsomedial (79% of control) region. Our results demonstrate a selective loss of C1 and C3 PNMT-positive neurons, providing the first quantitative evidence for damage to these presumed brainstem sympathetic premotor neurons in Parkinson's disease. These changes may underlie some of the autonomic symptoms occurring in this condition.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive neurons in the C1 and A2 regions of the medulla, the sites of the baroreflex arc, in 7 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 8 with Parkinson's disease (PD), 9 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 12 age-matched normal subjects to analyze the relationship between cardiovascular dysfunction and medullary catecholaminergic neurons. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) was marked in all the MSA patients and moderate in three PD patients. Three of the five ALS patients who had been on respirators showed lability of blood pressure; paroxysmal hypertension and nocturnal hypotension without compensatory tachycardia. All the MSA patients showed extremely marked decrease of TH-immunoreactive neurons in both the C1 and A2 regions. In the patients with Parkinson's disease, numerous TH-immunoreactive neurons contained Lewy bodies that were immunostained by antibody to TH. TH-immunoreactive neurons were decreased very markedly in the A2 regions of two patients with OH, and three patients without OH showed fairly marked decreases in the C1 or A2 region. In contrast, the number of TH-immunoreactive neurons in ALS was the same as in normal subjects. In MSA and some PD patients, orthostatic hypotension may partly be due to the involvement of the medullary catecholaminergic neurons. The lability of blood pressure in ALS probably is not related to the medullary catecholaminergic neurons.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that oxidative stress and mitochondrial respiratory failure with attendant decrease in energy output are implicated in nigral neuronal death in Parkinson disease (PD). It is not known, however, which cellular elements (neurons or glial cells) are major targets of oxygen-mediated damage. 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) was shown earlier to react with proteins to form stable adducts that can be used as markers of oxidative stress-induced cellular damage. We report here results of immunochemical studies using polyclonal antibodies directed against HNE-protein conjugates to label the site of oxidative damage in control subjects (ages 18-99 years) and seven patients that died of PD (ages 57-78 years). All the nigral melanized neurons in one of the midbrain sections were counted and classified into three groups according to the intensity of immunostaining for HNE-modified proteins--i.e., no staining, weak staining, and intensely positive staining. On average, 58% of nigral neurons were positively stained for HNE-modified proteins in PD; in contrast only 9% of nigral neurons were positive in the control subjects; the difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U test; P < 0.01). In contrast to the substantia nigra, the oculomotor neurons in the same midbrain sections showed no or only weak staining for HNE-modified proteins in both PD and control subjects; young control subjects did not show any immunostaining; however, aged control subjects showed weak staining in the oculomotor nucleus, suggesting age-related accumulation of HNE-modified proteins in the neuron. Our results indicate the presence of oxidative stress within nigral neurons in PD, and this oxidative stress may contribute to nigral cell death.",

    "abstract": "Evidence supports the role of hyperoxidation phenomena in the mechanism of nerve cell death in Parkinson's disease (PD). The oxidative degradation of dopamine, catalyzed by monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B), produces free radicals and thus could be implicated in the degenerative process. For this reason, we investigated by immunohistochemistry the distribution of MAO-B-containing cells in the midbrain of five patients with PD and five matched control subjects. MAO-B-like immunoreactivity was detected in glial cells, fibers, and neurons. Although most of the MAO-B-positive neurons probably belonged to the raphe dorsalis, we demonstrated by double-labeling immunohistochemistry that some of them were also dopaminergic. MAO-B-positive dopaminergic neurons were present in all dopaminergic groups of the control midbrain. Within the substantia nigra pars compacta, most dopaminergic neurons were located in the dorsal part of the structure. MAO-B-positive dopaminergic neurons were still detected in PD midbrains. Compared with control subjects, the loss of dopaminergic neurons containing MAO-B (-45%) was no higher than that of MAO-B-negative dopaminergic neurons (-59%). The density of MAO-B-positive glial cells varied in the control midbrains: high in the least affected dopaminergic group (the central gray substance) and low in the most affected region (the substantia nigra pars compacta). The density of MAO-B-positive glial cells within dopaminergic cell subgroups in control midbrains were negatively correlated (r = -0.94; p < 0.02) to the estimated neuronal loss in PD. We conclude that the presence of MAO-B in dopamine-containing neurons does not contribute to vulnerability in PD. Moreover, its presence in some glial cells might have a protective effect against oxidative stress induced by dopamine metabolism.",

Parvalbumin, a calcium binding protein, is involved in buffering intracellular calcium and in this study was localized within the majority of non-pigmented neurons of the human pars reticulata. Previous studies have shown that the parvalbumin-immunoreactive pars reticulata neurons are GABAergic and project to the motor thalamus and tectum. Their increased output, due to the loss of dopaminergic inhibition in Parkinson's disease, decreases cortical activation via thalamic pathways, causing parkinsonian symptoms. In Parkinson's disease there was a significant loss of parvalbumin-immunoreactivity from these neurons, though there was no evidence of actual cell loss. This loss of parvalbumin-immunoreactivity was detected only in those cases with end-stage Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the mesencephalon. Although the mechanism of this neuronal loss is still unknown, oxidative stress is very likely involved in the cascade of events leading to nerve cell death. Since nitric oxide could be involved in the production of free radicals, we analysed, using immunohistochemistry and histochemistry, the production systems of nitric oxide in the mesencephalon of four patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and three matched control subjects. Using specific antibodies directed against the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (the enzyme involved in the synthesis of nitric oxide), we found evidence to suggest that this isoform was present solely in glial cells displaying the morphological characteristics of activated macrophages. Immunohistochemical analysis performed with antibodies against the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase, however, revealed perikarya and processes of neurons but no glial cell staining. The number of nitric oxide synthase-containing cells was investigated by histoenzymology, using the NADPH-diaphorase activity of nitric oxide synthase. Histochemistry revealed (i) a significant increase in NADPH-diaphorase-positive glial cell density in the dopaminergic cell groups characterized by neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease and (ii) a neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease that was two-fold greater for pigmented NADPH-diaphorase-negative neurons than for pigmented NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons. These data suggest a potentially deleterious role of glial cells producing excessive levels of nitric oxide in Parkinson's disease, which may be neurotoxic for a subpopulation of dopaminergic neurons, especially those not expressing NADPH-diaphorase activity. However, it cannot be excluded that the presence of glial cells expressing nitric oxide synthase in the substantia nigra of patients with Parkinson's disease represents a consequence of dopaminergic neuronal loss.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and, to a lesser extent, the ventral tegmental area and catecholaminergic cell group A8. However, among these dopaminergic neurons, those expressing the calcium buffering protein calbindin are selectively preserved, suggesting that a rise in intracellular calcium concentrations may be involved in the cascade of events leading to nerve cell death in Parkinson's disease. We therefore analysed immunohistochemically the expression of the calcium-dependent protease calpain II (m-calpain) in the mesencephalon of patients with Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy or striatonigral degeneration, where nigral dopaminergic neurons degenerate, and matched controls without nigral involvement. Calpain immunoreactivity was found in fibers and neuronal perikarya in the substantia nigra, the ventral tegmental area, catecholaminergic cell group A8 and the locus coeruleus. In patients with Parkinson's disease but not with the other neurodegenerative disorders, m-calpain immunoreactivity was detected in fibers with an abnormal morphology and in Lewy bodies. Sequential double staining revealed that most of these m-calpain-positive fibers and neuronal perikarya co-expressed tyrosine hydroxylase, indicating that most m-calpain neurons are catecholaminergic. Quantitative analysis of m-calpain staining in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus revealed an increased density of fibers and neuronal perikarya in parkinsonian patients in both structures. These data suggest that increased calcium concentrations may be associated with nerve cell death in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "We studied the pigmented neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) from 8 controls and 20 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) using a computerized morphometric methodology. On the basis of neuronal topography, several anatomic regions were outlined in the SN. In these subregions the area, perimeter, diameter of the cell bodies and cell numbers were measured and were counted in the controls and PD patients. The measurements were made at the level of the exit of the third cranial nerve from the brain stem. In PD patients, when the whole SN was considered, the mean area, mean perimeter and diameter of the pigmented cell bodies were significantly reduced by 35%, 20% and 21% respectively from the control mean values. Regionally, the pigmented neuron area in the medial ventral part (VM), medial dorsal part (DM), lateral ventral part (VL), lateral dorsal part (DL) and pars lateralis part (PL) showed a significant reduction of 33-41% as compared to controls. In these subregions, a significant decrease in PD patients from the control mean values was seen both in the pigmented neuron perimeter, by 19-26%, and the diameter by 19-25%. This decrease in cell size suggests that, in PD patients, the remaining pigmented neurons in the SN are in a process of degeneration and atrophy. In PD patients the number of pigmented neurons in the whole SN decreased about 76% from control values. Evaluation of the influence of cell size on the apparent quantity of cells in sections indicates, however, that in PD patients the impact of true loss of pigmented neurons is far more dramatic than the impact of their decrease in size.",

    "abstract": "Defects of respiratory chain complexes were considered as possible pathogenetic mechanisms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Changes of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in four different nuclei of the substantia nigra of 8 PD cases and 10 age-matched controls were investigated by means of morphometry and immunohistochemistry. Pigmented neurons with COX defects were randomly distributed within the the four nuclei of PD cases, but only in the posterolateral nucleus was the numerical density of pigmented neurons with COX defects significantly increased compared with controls. The numerical density of pigmented neurons without COX defects was significantly reduced in the anteromedial, anterointermediolateral, and posterolateral nuclei in PD. The cell size of pigmented neurons with and without COX defects was significantly diminished in the anteromedial and posterolateral nuclei of PD cases. It is suggested that complex IV defects in nigral neurons are most probably a result of accelerated aging, but are least likely to be a primary aspect of the pathogenetic processes occurring in PD.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body disease (LBD) is poorly understood. In AD there is severe loss of neurons comprising the perforant pathway. To assess perforant pathway integrity in pure LBD we compared neuronal counts in layer II of the entorhinal cortex (ERC) in 11 cases of pure LBD that did not meet CERAD pathologic criteria for AD with ERC neuronal counts from seven AD cases with a similar disease duration and six cognitively normal individuals. We counted cell bodies/island in layer II of the ERC using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, tau/cresyl violet-stained sections at the level of the rostral-most body of the hippocampus. There was marked variability in neuronal counts among cases in the LBD group; LBD data overlapped with data from both normal and AD groups. Overall, perforant pathway perikaryal counts in LBD differed significantly from those in AD, but not from those in aged normals (mean perikarya/island = 30.09 +/- 8.95, 7.57 +/- 6.08, and 38.83 +/- 8.98, respectively; F = 26.131, P < 0.001). The percent of remaining neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles in LBD also overlapped with AD and control groups (16.17 = 13.85%, 87.86 +/- 11.81%, and 24.36 +/- 13.30% of remaining neurons, respectively, F = 65.62, P < 0.001). We conclude that although perforant pathway neuronal loss may occur in LBD, it is more often milder and more variable than that seen in AD.",

Seven patients with Lewy body Parkinson's disease were evaluated and compared with five controls. Four of the patients with Parkinson's disease had additional neuropathology, and the effect of concomitant pathology on A10 populations was also determined. Degeneration was not observed in the A8 regions of any patient, and only certain A10 nuclei were affected by the disease. The parabrachial pigmented nucleus situated dorsal to the substantial nigra, and the parapeduncular nucleus located rostromedially were significantly reduced by 40-50% in patients with Parkinson's disease. Few differences were found between patients with or without additional pathology, suggesting a similar pathogenic mechanism to that observed in the substantia nigra of these patients. However, patients with additional pathology also had serotonergic cell loss in the caudal linear nucleus. There was a reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity but no overt neurodegeneration in other A10 regions, suggesting the disease may also influence the production of dopamine in some surviving neurons.",

To test the hypothesis that this may relate to specific hypothalamic pathology in PD, we studied morphometrically the neuronal population of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) in PD patients and controls. Neuronal loss in the SON of PD patients was associated with increased somatic, nuclear, and nucleolar size of remaining neurons, suggesting compensatory response of these cells. We conclude that SON pathology is a feature of PD and may account for specific signs of neurohumoral dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies based on single sections have suggested a significant correlation between pigmented neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (SN) and clinical features in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, disector (DS) counts-unbiased and accurate stereological estimates have not been available. To evaluate total neuron numbers in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNpc) in relation to clinical features, we estimated the neuron counts in the SNpc by the DS method in brain samples from 12 controls and 12 PD patients. The total number of pigmented neurons in the whole SNpc was significantly reduced in PD patients (to 45% of the control mean, P < 0.001). The density of pigmented neurons (neuron/mm3) was reduced to 51% of the average control value (P < 0.001). No significant difference was seen in the volume (mm3) of the SNpc between PD patients and controls. Furthermore, the total number of pigmented neurons in the SNpc showed a significant negative correlation with the duration of disease (r = -0.86, P < 0.001) and with the stage of disease (r = -0.58, P < 0.05) in PD patients. Using an unbiased neuron counting method, these relationships, for the first time, demonstrate that the more severe pigmented neuronal loss in the SNpc is associated with the longer duration and the more severe stage of disease in PD patients.",

We quantitatively examined the neuronal density of the arcuate nucleus in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA, n = 3), Parkinson's disease (PD, n = 3), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n = 2), and control subjects (n = 6), and statistically compared the findings in each group. Although the neuronal densities in PD and ALS patients were not different from that in the controls, MSA patients showed a marked depletion of neurons in the arcuate nucleus. The neuronal density (/mm2, mean +/- SEM) in the arcuate nucleus was 9.27 +/- 10.4 in MSA, and was significantly decreased (P < 0.05; Wilcoxon test), compared with that in control subjects (87.1 +/- 12.2). These results suggest that the lesioned arcuate nucleus is related to the pathogenesis of dysatonomia in MSA.",

We systemically studied the autonomic nervous system in patients with PD. Lewy bodies were widely distributed in the hypothalamus, sympathetic system (intermediolateral nucleus of the thoracic cord and sympathetic ganglia) and parasympathetic system (dorsal vagal and sacral parasympathetic nuclei). The number of neurons in the intermediolateral nucleus was significantly reduced. Furthermore, Lewy bodies were also found in the enteric nervous system of the alimentary tract, cardiac plexus, pelvic plexus and adrenal medulla. These findings indicate that both central and peripheral autonomic nervous systems are involved in the disease process in PD.",

    "abstract": "Depletion of reduced glutathione occurs in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease and in incidental Lewy body disease (presymptomatic Parkinson's disease) which may implicate oxidative stress in the neurodegenerative process. In this study mercury orange fluorescent staining and immunostaining with an antibody to reduced glutathione have been used to determine the distribution of reduced glutathione in the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease compared with normal individuals. Mercury orange staining showed moderate background levels of fluorescence in the neuropil in both control and Parkinson's disease substantia nigra and localised reduced glutathione to the somata of melanized nigral neurons and glial elements of the neuropil. Neuronal nuclei revealed a relative lack of fluorescence after mercury orange staining. There was a significant depletion of reduced glutathione in surviving neurons in Parkinson's disease compared to nerve cell populations in control tissue. Mercury orange fluorescence indicated a high concentration of reduced glutathione in a subpopulation of non-neuronal cells, most likely astrocytes or microglia. Immunohistochemical examination of nigral tissue from the same Parkinson's disease and control patients with an antibody to glutathione showed staining in neuronal perikarya and axonodendritic processes of melanized nigral neurons which was generally most intense in control neurons. Moderately intense staining of the background neuropil, most prominent in control nigras, and staining of capillary walls was also detected. Intense staining was seen in cells with the morphological features of glial cells in both control and PD nigra. These data show a significant presence of reduced glutathione in the cell bodies and axons of nigral neurons. They are in agreement with biochemical studies showing depletion of reduced glutathione in substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease, and indicate a significant loss of neuronal reduced glutathione in surviving nigral neurons in Parkinson's disease.",

    "abstract": "Depression is frequently encountered in Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, more than half of the PD patients have a disturbed dexamethasone suppression test, which is associated with increased activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons. We recently found an increase in CRH neuron number, CRH-messenger RNA, and vasopressin colocalization in CRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of depressed patients, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of depression.",
